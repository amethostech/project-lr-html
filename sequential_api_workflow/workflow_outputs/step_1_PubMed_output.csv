"Chronic hand eczema is a multifactorial disease that can impact quality of life considerably. This observational questionnaire study aimed to investigate real-world treatments and patients' experiences of disease burden across the broad severity spectrum represent-ed by the general chronic hand eczema population. The study included 1,948 individuals from 6 countries (mean age 43.2 years; 64.5% females) with self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic hand eczema. Ongoing treatment was reported in 68.6%, which included systemics or phototherapy (with or without topicals; 10.7%), topical corticosteroids (with or without additional topicals; 36.0%) and other topical treatments (no topical corticosteroids; 21.8%). At survey time, 43.0% were in flare state. About half, 51.1%, reported moderate to severe disease signs (past week). Treatment with topical corticosteroids was suboptimal in 9.7% of those with moderate to severe disease. Experience of symptoms was common, particularly itch. Symptom burden differed significantly between groups with different treatments and severity levels; it was highest among those reporting systemics/phototherapy and those for whom topical corticosteroids were suboptimal. The results indicate that, despite a high treatment rate, chronic hand eczema is associated with a considerable disease burden that varies significantly across the severity spectrum. A particularly high burden in treatment stages beyond topical corticosteroids indicates a need for more effective management of symptoms.",Sonja,Molin,Molin Sonja; Fargnoli Maria Concetta; Crepy Marie Noelle; Gim&#xe9;nez-Arnau Ana Maria; Brignoli Lysel; Le Calv&#xe9; Perrine; Krupka Michal; Norlin Jenny M; Apfelbacher Christian; Bewley Anthony,10.2340/actadv.v106.44493,,,Eczema,Hand Dermatoses,Self Report,Dermatologic Agents,,therapy; diagnosis; epidemiology; drug therapy,therapy; diagnosis; epidemiology,administration & dosage,administration & dosage; adverse effects,,Humans,Female,Eczema,Male,Adult,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema","Real-world Evidence of Self-reported Treatments, Signs, and Symptom Burden in Chronic Hand Eczema: Findings from the Multinational CHECK Study."
"ICP-332 is a tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor currently under investigation for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICP-332 for moderate to severe AD. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted between February 6 and November 7, 2023, across 19 centers in China. Individuals aged 18 to 75 years who had diagnosis of AD for 1 year or longer and a history of contraindication or inadequate response to topical therapies were included. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive ICP-332 at 80 mg or 120 mg, or placebo orally once daily for 4 weeks. Study participants and personnel were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was safety. The key efficacy outcome was the percentage change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at week 4. Other outcomes included percentages of patients achieving EASI-75 (a &#x2265;75% improvement in EASI) and Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with 2 or more points improvement. This study included 75 patients (mean [SD] age, 37.3 [18.0] years in the ICP-332 groups and 44.5 [17.4] years in the placebo group; 21 women [28%] and 54 men [72%]). Among the 74 patients included in the safety set, 17 of 25 (68%) in the placebo group, 19 of 25 (76%) in the 80-mg ICP-332 group, and 18 of 24 (75%) in the 120-mg ICP-332 group experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, with all events being mild or moderate. The most common adverse event was decreased blood fibrinogen (1 of 25 [4%] in the placebo group, 6 of 25 [44%] in the 80-mg ICP-332 group, and 5 of 24 [21%] in the 120-mg ICP-332 group). Percentage reductions in EASI at week 4 were -78.2% (95% CI, -89.8% to -66.6%) in the 80-mg ICP-332 group, -72.5% (95% CI, -84.3% to -60.7%) in the 120-mg ICP-332 group, and -16.7% (95% CI, -28.7% to -4.6%) for those receiving placebo. Mean differences vs placebo for percentage reductions from baseline at week 4 in EASI were -61.6% (95% CI, -78.4% to -44.7%; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) and -55.8% (95% CI, -72.8% to -38.9%; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) for 80-mg ICP-332 and 120-mg ICP-332, respectively. There was a statistically significant higher EASI-75 response rate with both ICP-332 doses (64.0% for each; difference vs placebo, 56.0%; 95% CI, 34.4%-77.6%; P&#x2009;<&#x2009;.001) than with placebo and a greater percentage of Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of 0 or 1 and improvement of 2 or more points at week 4 in the 80-mg ICP-332 group vs placebo (36.0%; difference vs placebo, 32.0%; 95% CI, 11.7%-52.3%; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.005).

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense itch and eczematous skin lesions. Upadacitinib, a selective oral Janus kinase inhibitor, and dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, are both approved treatments for moderate-to-severe AD. In period 1 of the LEVEL UP phase 3b/4 head-to-head study, upadacitinib-treated patients demonstrated higher simultaneous achievement of near complete skin clearance and little to no itch compared with dupilumab after 16 weeks of treatment in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. The objective of period 2 of the LEVEL UP study was to assess the efficacy and safety of switching from dupilumab to upadacitinib in patients with inadequate response to dupilumab. Following period 1 of the LEVEL UP study, patients not achieving &#x2265; 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) from baseline at week 16 entered an additional 16-week extension phase (period 2). In period 2, patients receiving dupilumab were switched to upadacitinib 15 mg, with the potential to escalate to 30 mg based on clinical response. End points in period 2 included EASI 90, Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (WP-NRS) 0/1, and simultaneous achievement of both EASI 90 and WP-NRS 0/1 at week 20 and week 32. A total of 208 patients were switched from dupilumab to upadacitinib, entering period 2 of the study. At week 32, response rates for patients who switched were: 79.6%, 58.7%, and 19.9% achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, and EASI 100, respectively; 60.2% achieving Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale improvement &#x2265; 4 among those with baseline WP-NRS &#x2265; 4; 37.0% achieving WP-NRS 0/1 among those with baseline WP-NRS > 1; and 26.8% simultaneously achieving EASI 90 and WP-NRS 0/1. Clinically, meaningful outcomes were also observed at week 20. No new safety signals were identified compared with the established safety profile of upadacitinib. The current findings suggest that switching from dupilumab to upadacitinib may be an effective treatment strategy for patients who do not meet moderate-to-optimal treatment targets with dupilumab.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with significant physical and psychosocial burden. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4R&#x3b1;, has proven to be effective for moderate-to-severe AD, but long-term real-world data remain limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness, safety, and achievement of minimal disease activity (MDA) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab over a 5-year period. A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted at the Dermatologic Clinic of the University of Turin, including 583 patients aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;6&#x2009;years treated with dupilumab between November 2018 and January 2025. Effectiveness was measured by Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Pruritus-Numerical Rating Scale (P-NRS), and Sleep Loss-Numerical Rating Scale (S-NRS) scores, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). MDA was defined as EASI-90 combined with P-NRS&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;1. Safety and drug survival were also assessed. Dupilumab treatment resulted in significant and sustained reductions in EASI and symptom scores over 5&#x2009;years. The proportion of patients achieving MDA increased from 22.0% at 16&#x2009;weeks to 56.0% at 208&#x2009;weeks and remained stable at 55.3% through 5&#x2009;years. Male sex and childhood onset may reduce treatment success, warranting further study. The safety profile was favorable, with low discontinuation rates, and conjunctivitis as the most common adverse event.

"&#xa0;Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease, significantly impacting a patient's quality of life. To date, a substantial proportion of patients present an insufficient response to available treatment options. Lebrikizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin 13, has shown a promising clinical benefit in phase 3 trials, however, real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis (AD) are limited and mostly restricted to Asian populations. Aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with AD. &#xa0;This retrospective study included 35 patients from a largely homogenous Central European population with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis treated with lebrikizumab at the Dermatology Department of the St. Josef-Hospital in Bochum between December 2023 and April 2025. Eczema area and severity index (EASI), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), peak-pruritus (PP)-numerical rating scale (NRS) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) were assessed during the treatment. Lebrikizumab reduced all clinical indices by week 4, with improvements maintained through week 16. At week 24, the achievement rates for EASI-50 (50% reduction in EASI), EASI-75 (75% reduction in EASI) and EASI-90 (90% reduction in EASI) were 100%, 75% and 75%, respectively, and the SCORAD-50 (50% reduction in SCORAD) response rate was 64.2%. The proportions of patients achieving a&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;4-point reduction in the PP-NRS and in the DLQI at week 24 were 55.8% and 91.6%, respectively.

"Hand eczema is the most common occupational skin disease (OSD), often leading to sick leave or job termination. Standard diagnostic procedures are often ambiguous. Molecular classification has been described to improve differentiation between eczema and psoriasis, which is the most common differential diagnosis. Since 2020, a cohort of 287 patients with suspected, occupational hand and/or foot dermatoses (eczema or psoriasis) has been established in Germany. The current analysis focuses on descriptive results on the days of absence from work, occupational retention and legal recognition of OSD after 24 months. A total of 38.9% of the patients did not receive a distinct clinical diagnosis, while molecular diagnostics provided results in 93.1% of these cases. Sick leave days significantly decreased over 2 years (p<0.005) from a mean of 28.7 to 8.2 days. Legal recognition of OSD tripled from 10.1% to 30.2%. Job terminations due to skin diseases reached 27.1%, primarily from job changes or unemployment. Molecular diagnostics enhance diagnostic precision and may support improved prevention and disease management, reducing sick leave. The findings underscore the individual severity and social impact of skin diseases like eczema and psoriasis in high-risk employments.",Philipp,Bentz,Bentz Philipp; Eyerich Kilian; Skudlik Christoph; Schr&#xf6;der-Kraft Claudia; L&#xf6;ffler Harald; Pf&#xf6;hler Claudia; Leitz Nicolas; Th&#xf6;lken Karisa; Weisshaar Elke,10.2340/actadv.v106.adv-2025-0023,,,Sick Leave,"Dermatitis, Occupational",Psoriasis,Eczema,Molecular Diagnostic Techniques,diagnosis; classification; genetics,diagnosis; classification; genetics,diagnosis; classification; genetics,,,Humans,Sick Leave,Male,Female,Adult,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Molecular Classification in a Cohort of Occupational Dermatological Patients: Diagnostic Results and Course of Ability to Work and Sick Leave Over Two Years.
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease in which dysbiosis of gut and skin microbiota contributes to pathogenesis and severity. Washed microbiota transplantation (WMT)-an improved form of fecal microbiota transplantation with enhanced safety and microbiota quality control-has shown efficacy in a single reported adolescent case. However, clinical data on WMT in AD and its effects on the skin and gut microbiota remain limited. Twenty-three patients with moderate-to-severe AD received at least two courses of WMT between January 2022 and December 2023. Disease activity was evaluated using the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for itch, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Peripheral blood counts, cytokine profiles, lymphocyte subsets, and gut and skin microbiota were assessed before and after treatment. WMT was well tolerated (58 sessions; 5.2% mild adverse events) and significantly improved SCORAD, EASI, DLQI, and NRS scores, with greater EASI reductions in adults than in children. Absolute basophil counts decreased significantly after treatment, whereas other hematologic and cytokine parameters remained stable. Gut microbiota showed an increased Gut Microbiome Health Index, a decreased Microbial Dysbiosis Index, and enrichment of short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa, including the Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Lachnospiraceae, and Coprococcus. Skin microbiota shifted from Staphylococcus dominance to higher abundances of Acinetobacter, Perlucidibaca, and other potentially protective genera, inversely correlating with disease severity and systemic inflammation. WMT appears safe and effective in alleviating clinical manifestations of AD while reshaping both gut and skin microbiota. These parallel microbial shifts support the gut-skin axis as a therapeutic target and highlight WMT as a promising microbiota-centered intervention for immune-mediated skin diseases.",Wanying,Deng,Deng Wanying; Chen Dongmian; Wei Yaofei; Chen Wenjia; Chen Kaitong; Zhong Haojie; He Xingxiang,10.1186/s12866-026-04717-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Washed microbiota transplantation relieves atopic dermatitis via gut-skin microbiome rebalancing.

"Historically, psoriasis (Pso) and atopic dermatitis (AD) were considered mutually exclusive diseases due to their activation of opposing immune pathways-Th17 in Pso and Th2 in AD. However, growing clinical evidence and systematic reviews have challenged this dichotomy, demonstrating that both conditions can coexist in the same individual. This paper aims to provide an overview of the nomenclature, epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, and clinical features of coexistent psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, whether drug-induced or not. These conditions are also collectively referred to as ""PsoDermatitis"".",Riccardo,Balestri,Balestri Riccardo; Magnano Michela; Infusino Salvatore Domenico; Ioris Tommaso; Lacava Rossella; Girardelli Carlo Rene; Rech Giulia,10.3390/jcm15010130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Unravelling the Mystery of Psoriasis Dermatitis (PsoDermatitis): A Practical Guide to Recognition and Management.
"Atopic eczema and asthma frequently co-occur, forming a distinct complex phenotype that likely arises from shared genetic pathways and early-life environmental influences. We aimed to investigate whether variants inand-previously identified in a genome-wide interaction study-influence susceptibility to atopic eczema and the asthma-eczema phenotype and whether early-life environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure modifies these genetic effects. A total of 188 Caucasian children under 2 years at recruitment were prospectively followed up to 6 years of age. Eligibility of all participants for the study or control group was based on a questionnaire and a physician-confirmed diagnosis of eczema and asthma. Early-life ETS exposure was assessed by parental questionnaire. All participants were genotyped forandSNPs. Thers918949 [T] allele was associated with the combined asthma-eczema phenotype but not with eczema alone. Synergistic gene-environment interactions were identified for bothand, with the highest risk of the combined asthma-eczema phenotype observed among ETS-exposed carriers of risk alleles.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition often associated with skin pain and sleep disturbance. The AD Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (SP-NRS) and Sleep Disturbance NRS (SD-NRS) are single-item patient-reported outcome measures developed to assess AD-related skin pain and sleep disturbance severity, respectively, in AD clinical trials. We used data from three randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of rocatinlimab in adults (aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;18&#xa0;years) (ROCKET-IGNITE and ROCKET-SHUTTLE) and adolescents (aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;12 to <&#x2009;18&#xa0;years) (ROCKET-ASTRO) with moderate-to-severe AD to assess the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the AD SP-NRS and SD-NRS. Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) supported the psychometric evaluation, and we estimated meaningful change thresholds for the AD SP-NRS and SD-NRS using anchor-based methods, which we confirmed with distribution-based methods. We included data from both the treatment arm and placebo in our analyses, and we analyzed results from adult and adolescent populations separately. This psychometric analysis sample used 262 adults (ROCKET-IGNITE, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;145; ROCKET-SHUTTLE, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;117) and 109 adolescents (ROCKET-ASTRO, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;109), subsets from the initial data cuts of the respective clinical trials, in the psychometric analysis sample. Both AD SP-NRS and SD-NRS scores demonstrated high test-retest reliability for both adults and adolescents (intraclass correlation coefficients&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.80) and moderate-to-strong (|r|&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.30) positive correlations with most supporting COAs. Anchor-based meaningful within-patient change threshold ranges derived for AD SP-NRS and SD-NRS scores supported both 3-point and 4-point improvement thresholds for characterizing clinically meaningful changes. The AD SP-NRS and SD-NRS are reliable, valid, and responsive measures for assessing moderate-to-severe AD in adults and adolescents in clinical trials.

"Hand eczema is a common inflammatory dermatosis in primary care, characterized by erythema, pruritus, scaling, fissures, and functional impairment. It encompasses various clinical and etiological forms, either acute or chronic, related to irritant, allergic, or atopic mechanisms. When the condition persists for more than three months or recurs at least twice within one year, it is defined as chronic hand eczema. This represents one of the most prevalent dermatoses, with substantial clinical, occupational, and psychosocial impact. Its multifactorial pathogenesis involves genetic predisposition, barrier dysfunction, and environmental exposures, particularly to occupational irritants and allergens. In primary care, the family physician plays a key role in the early recognition of hand eczema, patient education on skin care and preventive measures, and in identifying alarm signs that warrant referral to a dermatologist. A focused history and clinical examination enable diagnostic orientation and allow the initiation, from the first consultation, of appropriate topical treatment, emollient use, and protection against triggering factors. Referral should be considered in severe, refractory cases or those with significant functional or occupational impact, in order to assess advanced therapies such as phototherapy, alitretinoin, dupilumab, oral JAK inhibitors, or topical delgocitinib.",F J,Navarro-Trivi&#xf1;o,Navarro-Trivi&#xf1;o F J,10.1016/j.semerg.2025.102673,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",[Hand eczema: comprehensive management and therapeutic perspectives in primary care].
"Various scoring systems for atopic dermatitis assess different aspects of the disease, but the supporting data on their validation and reliability are often limited. To ensure accurate interpretations, it is essential to conduct thorough reliability and agreement testing. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of 5 atopic dermatitis assessment tools - Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index (oSCORAD), validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD), Three Item Severity (TIS) score, and Six-Area, Six-Sign Atopic Dermatitis (SASSAD) severity score - among trained dermatology residents. Thirteen patients were assessed twice by 11 raters using each scoring system. Intrarater and interrater reliability were evaluated. EASI demonstrated the highest interrater reliability (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.768 and 0.796); SASSAD and oSCORAD followed closely (ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.741 and 0.772; ICC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.723 and 0.709, respectively). The TIS (ICC=0.553 and 0.584) and IGA (Kendall's W=0.273 and 0.315) exhibited the lowest reliability.

We aimed to quantitatively evaluate changes in skin physiological and biochemical parameters following the application of a ceramide-based moisturizer (test cream) compared with an aqueous moisturizer (control cream) in healthy volunteers and eczema patients. Skin physiological assessments and CRS measurements were performed to evaluate water content and ceramide levels in both superficial and deeper skin layers after application of the two moisturizers. CRS revealed a significant increase in water content following test cream application, indicating improved skin hydration, whereas physiological measurements detected no statistically significant changes, underscoring the greater sensitivity of CRS. The test cream also significantly enhanced ceramide levels in both superficial and deeper skin layers, whereas the control cream increased ceramide levels only in the superficial stratum corneum (SC). These findings suggest that the test cream has a substantial positive impact on hand eczema, potentially improving both skin barrier function and biochemical properties.",Poongkulali,Rajarahm,Rajarahm Poongkulali; Bi Renzhe; Attia Amalina Ebrahim; Zhang Ruochong; Thng Steven Tien Guan; Ng Sue Phay; Yuan Linzhu; Olivo Malini,10.1117/1.JBO.30.S3.S34117,,,Ceramides,"Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Skin,Skin Cream,Emollients,chemistry; analysis,methods,chemistry; drug effects,chemistry,drug therapy,Humans,Ceramides,"Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Adult,Female,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Noninvasive assessment of skin barrier function: evaluating ceramide-based moisturizer using confocal Raman spectroscopy.
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that affects approximately 10% to 20% of children, imposing substantial health and economic burdens. Although education for patients and caregivers is acknowledged as a crucial element in the management of AD, conventional approaches, such as workshops or in-person consultations, are often resource intensive and face challenges related to scalability, personalization, and relapse prevention. Digital tools present promising alternatives; however, empirical evidence supporting their effectiveness in young children is currently limited. This study aimed to evaluate whether a smartphone-based patient-caregiver educational program could reduce relapse rates in children aged 0 to 6 years with moderate-to-severe AD, compared with conventional outpatient consultation alone. In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-controlled trial, 615 children were enrolled across 12 tertiary pediatric dermatology centers in China and randomized (1:1) to receive either a smartphone-based digital education program with standard care (intervention group) or conventional face-to-face consultation only (control group). The 12-week digital program, delivered via the WeChat-based Skin Care E-Station platform, included structured multimedia modules, interactive educational materials, and a dynamic electronic action plan tailored to the child's age and disease stage. The primary endpoint was the 12-week relapse rate after the acute treatment phase. The secondary endpoints included changes in disease severity (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure) and quality of life (Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index or Infant's Dermatitis Quality of Life Index and Dermatitis Family Impact) up to 52 weeks. Among 615 randomized participants (mean age 3.3, SD 1.7 y; n=317, 51.5% male), relapse at 12 weeks occurred significantly less frequently in the digital education group than in the control group (16.6% vs 24.0%; relative risk 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96; P=.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed superior relapse-free survival over the first 100 days (hazard ratio 0.688, 95% CI 0.490-0.966; P=.03). Differences in relapse rates beyond 12 weeks and in secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. Engagement tracking indicated high adherence to the intervention, with 58.0% of caregivers maintaining regular weekly use of the digital platform. A structured smartphone-based patient-caregiver educational intervention significantly reduced short-term relapse risk among young children with moderate-to-severe AD, likely through improved caregiver recognition and early management of disease flares. Although effects diminished beyond 12 weeks, this approach demonstrates that scalable digital education is a feasible and effective adjunct to standard care in pediatric AD. Future research should focus on sustaining engagement, optimizing long-term reinforcement, and assessing cost-effectiveness in diverse caregiver populations.",Huan,Yang,Yang Huan; Shu Hong; Wang Liu-Hui; Li Ping; Li Yun-Ling; Li Qin-Feng; Han Xiu-Ping; Tian Jing; Chang Jing; Qian Hua; Chen Jing-Ping; Ding Xin-Qiang; Wu Pan-Qian; Dou Li-Min; Luo Zhen; Li Wei; Lin Yang-Yang; Li Lin; Yue Shu-Zhen; Gu Yang; Yang Li; Sun Xiao-Hong; Luo Xiao-Yan; Ma Lin; Wang Hua,10.2196/79559,,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Smartphone,Patient Education as Topic,Eczema,,therapy,methods,education,therapy,,Humans,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Smartphone,Infant,"Child, Preschool",2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema","Smartphone-Based Digital Eczema Education Program for Atopic Dermatitis in Children Aged 0 to 6 Years: Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel Controlled Clinical Study."
"Intrinsic atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with pruritus and eczematous lesions of skin. A long-lasting cycle of itch-scratch roots results in substantial morbidities and discomfort. Treatment of patients with moderate to severe dermatitis is a challenge. To evaluate the efficacy of a treatment based on mineral salts and natural antioxidants agents in patients with AD. In this prospective study, 34 patients with AD were treated for 14 days. Patients were evaluated before and after treatment. The effects were studied by the following clinical measurements: Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Body Surface Area (BSA), and Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD). Patient-reported measurements were also assessed: Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Biopsies were performed in 10 patients and immunohistochemistry tests in 7 patients. All clinical and patient-reported measurements showed a strong difference before and after treatment. The epidermis thickness was significantly reduced, as well as the lymphocyte infiltration and the reduction of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD117 cells. No adverse events were observed. This study shows that the severity of intrinsic dermatitis was drastically reduced with the treatment of mineral salts and natural antioxidants agents.

"Effective management of moderate to severe Chronic Hand Eczema (CHE) requires improved understanding of its etiological subtypes, signs and symptoms, and comorbidities. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with moderate to severe CHE. This was a multinational retrospective online chart review in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Physicians&#xa0;were asked to identify eligible patients from medical records to provide retrospective data over the past 12&#x2009;months for up to 10 adult patients treated with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or for whom TCS were contraindicated. A total of 292 physicians completed forms for 1939 patients (56.8% with moderate and 43.2% with severe CHE). The most frequent etiological subtypes were irritant contact dermatitis (40.1%), atopic dermatitis (33.1%) and allergic contact dermatitis (27.5%). Palms (56.6%), fingertips (41.6%) and backs of hands (40.8%) were the most affected areas. Erythema and pruritus were the most frequent signs and symptoms. A history of atopic dermatitis was reported for 43.8% of patients. In conclusion, patients with moderate to severe CHE present with multiple etiological subtypes and a range of signs and symptoms. Many patients had no atopic condition besides CHE, and no history of atopic dermatitis, indicating that CHE is not simply atopic dermatitis of the hands.",Maria Concetta,Fargnoli,Fargnoli Maria Concetta; Molin Sonja; Bewley Anthony; Apfelbacher Christian; Brignoli Lysel; Morillo Alexanne; Didriksen Apol Eydna; Maslin Douglas; Cr&#xe9;py Marie-No&#xeb;lle; Gim&#xe9;nez-Arnau Ana Maria,10.1080/09546634.2025.2603121,,,Hand Dermatoses,Eczema,"Dermatitis, Atopic","Dermatitis, Allergic Contact",,etiology; drug therapy; diagnosis; epidemiology,etiology; drug therapy; diagnosis; epidemiology,epidemiology; drug therapy; diagnosis,epidemiology; drug therapy; diagnosis,drug therapy; epidemiology; diagnosis,Humans,Retrospective Studies,Male,Female,Hand Dermatoses,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema","Moderate to severe Chronic Hand Eczema in clinical practice: etiological subtypes, clinical signs and symptoms, and comorbidities-results from the RWEAL study."
"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) often exclude older adults and patients with comorbidities, limiting the generalizability of trial findings to real-world populations. Despite the growing use of biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) in clinical practice, the extent to which real-world patients meet RCT eligibility criteria and their associated safety outcomes remains unclear. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a large, multicenter international cohort of adolescents and adults with AD treated with biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or systemic JAKis (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) between October 2017 and March 2023 across 16 dermatology centers. Eligibility was defined according to commonly applied RCT criteria. Patients meeting&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 exclusion criterion were classified as ineligible. Demographic, clinical, and safety outcomes were analyzed. Among 2154 patients, 514 (23.9%) were ineligible. The most frequent reasons were Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)&#x2009;<&#x2009;16 (67.9%), age&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;75&#xa0;years (21.8%), and cardiovascular disease (13.0%). Ineligibility patterns differed across treatments: patients receiving JAKis were most often ineligible because of EASI&#x2009;<&#x2009;16 (92.8%), whereas ineligibility among biologic users more commonly reflected also age or cardiovascular comorbidity. Ineligible patients were older, had more non-atopic comorbidities, and had lower measured baseline disease activity. Safety profiles were generally favorable. Among biologic-treated patients, adverse event rates were similar between eligible and ineligible groups. In the JAKi cohort, overall adverse events were more frequent in ineligible patients (52.9% vs. 42.6%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.051), with acneiform eruption and lipid abnormalities emerging as the most distinct differences. No unexpected safety signals were identified in either treatment group. Nearly one-quarter of real-world patients with AD would not have met eligibility criteria for pivotal RCTs, yet both biologics and JAK inhibitors demonstrated acceptable safety profiles in these populations. While adverse events were more frequent among ineligible patients receiving JAKis, findings require further investigation to determine their clinical relevance, particularly regarding long-term cardiovascular outcomes.",Jos&#xe9; Miguel,Alvarenga,Alvarenga Jos&#xe9; Miguel; Yeung Jensen; Prajapati Vimal; Ribero Simone; Balato Anna; Marzano Angelo Valerio; Cruz Maria Jo&#xe3;o; Paiva Lopes Maria Jo&#xe3;o; Lazaridou Elizabeth; Carrascosa Jose-Manuel; Farinha Pedro; Duarte Bruno; Sood Siddhartha; Rankin Brian D; Ortoncelli Michela; Caccavale Stefano; Ferrucci Silvia Mariel; Pires Rosa Gilberto; Daponte Athina Ioanna; Silvi Gianmarco; Peris Ketty; Gori Niccol&#xf2;; Herranz Pedro; Prignano Francesca; Kolios Antonio; Rompoti Natalia; Gregoriou Stamatios; Gkalpakiotis Spyridon; Chiricozzi Andrea; Torres Tiago,10.1007/s13555-025-01633-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Clinical Trial Eligibility in Atopic Dermatitis: Data from a Large Real-World International Cohort.
"Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) have revolutionized the management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Although agents approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as upadacitinib and abrocitinib, are widely used, and baricitinib and ivarmacitinib are under investigation, direct head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing these agents are lacking. Our aim was to rank the short-term efficacy of four oral JAKis, upadacitinib (15/30&#x2009;mg), abrocitinib (100/200&#x2009;mg), baricitinib (2/4&#x2009;mg), and ivarmacitinib (4/8&#x2009;mg), in moderate-to-severe AD using a Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis (BNMA). Conducted per PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251116775), this study systematically reviewed phase 2 and 3 RCTs evaluating JAKi monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Primary endpoints included: (1) &#x2265;&#x2009;75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), (2) Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA-AD 0/1), and (3) &#x2265;&#x2009;4-point reduction in itch numeric rating scale (Itch NRS) at 12-16&#x2009;weeks. Bayesian hierarchical modeling estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs), and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities defined the treatment hierarchy. Nine RCTs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;4261) were included. Upadacitinib 30&#x2009;mg demonstrated the greatest efficacy across all endpoints, EASI-75 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;12.3; 95% CrI 7.9-18.7), IGA-AD 0/1 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;18.9; 95% CrI 12.0-29.7), and Itch NRS (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;11.1; 95% CrI 7.2-17.5), followed by upadacitinib 15&#x2009;mg, abrocitinib 200&#x2009;mg, and ivarmacitinib 8&#x2009;mg. Baricitinib 2&#x2009;mg and 4&#x2009;mg consistently ranked lowest. SUCRA values confirmed upadacitinib 30&#x2009;mg as the top performer (97%-98%). Among oral JAKis, upadacitinib 30&#x2009;mg, followed by upadacitinib 15&#x2009;mg, achieved the most consistent short-term efficacy, providing superior skin clearance and itch relief. Abrocitinib 200&#x2009;mg and ivarmacitinib 8&#x2009;mg showed intermediate benefits, whereas baricitinib displayed modest effects. These findings support a provisional efficacy preference for upadacitinib in managing moderate-to-severe AD unresponsive to biologic or topical therapies.",Arya,Babul,Babul Arya; Mehta Devina; Soliman Yssra; Hussain Momina; Babul Najib,10.1111/ijd.70228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Upadacitinib Leads in Efficacy: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of Four JAK Inhibitors in Moderate-To-Severe Atopic Dermatitis.
"Tralokinumab, an anti-IL-13 antibody, is effective for atopic dermatitis (AD); however, its long-term (>&#x2009;1&#x2009;year) effectiveness specific to each anatomical site is unknown in real-world settings. To evaluate 72-week effectiveness of tralokinumab on different anatomical sites in AD, we studied 208 patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with tralokinumab for 72&#x2009;weeks. Eczema area and severity index (EASI) scores were analyzed on four anatomical sites (head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). Tralokinumab consistently reduced EASI on all anatomical sites. The achievement rates of EASI 75 and 100 on each site gradually increased from Week 4 to Week 72, and those on lower limbs appeared higher compared to the other sites. The percent reductions of EASI throughout 72&#x2009;weeks appeared slightly lower on head and neck compared to the other sites. Week 72 achievement rate of EASI 75 on head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, or lower limbs was 80.4%, 80%, 80.3%, or 86.7%, while that of EASI 100 was 37.3%, 25.0%, 27.4%, and 40.0%, respectively.

"Hand eczema is a common, debilitating condition affecting quality of life. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of patients with hand eczema in Guangdong, China, toward their condition. A cross-sectional study was conducted at our hospital from September 21, 2023, to July 31, 2024, using a self-designed KAP questionnaire. A total of 612 valid questionnaires were collected. The mean (SD) scores for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 9.25 (2.55) (possible range: 0-23), 35.68 (6.02) (possible range: 10-50), and 24.03 (5.18) (possible range: 8-40), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that a higher attitude score (OR&#x202f;=&#x202f;1.209,&#x202f;<&#x202f;0.001) was independently associated with more proactive practices.

"Excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation and high humidity in the natural environment pose significant risks to human skin. Research indicates that the human skin surface becomes highly susceptible to various dermatological conditions when the UV index exceeds level 7. Similarly, humidity surpassing 70% can induce diseases such as eczema, dermatitis, and various allergic reactions. There is a compelling need for real-time monitoring of ambient UV levels and humidity intensity. In this work, high-performance optoelectronic logic gates (OELGs) based on a CsPbCl/p-Si heterojunction were fabricated by a two-step spin-coating method. Based on different bias voltages and light intensity, the five logic functions (AND, OR, NOR, NOT and NAND) of the OELGs were implemented. Specifically, the OR gate was displayed for real-time environmental monitoring. Whatever the UV intensity exceeds level 7 or the ambient humidity surpasses 70%, the device outputs signal ""1"" to trigger the alarm, suggesting that individuals take timely protective measures. The findings illustrate the substantial potential of CsPbCl/p-Si heterojunction OELGs for applications in skin safety monitor systems.",Haiting,Zhang,Zhang Haiting; Ji Tianchen; Zhong Xuanqi; Wang Jia; Li Chaoyang; Zhang Ruihuan; Liu Xun; Song Xiaoxian; Yue Zhen; Zhang Jingjing; Dai Zijie; Ye Yunxia; Yao Jianquan,10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02950,,,Skin,Silicon,Logic,,,adverse effects,radiation effects,chemistry,,,Humans,Ultraviolet Rays,Skin,Silicon,Humidity,2026,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema","{'sub': 3, '#text': 'Skin Safety Monitor Based on CsPbCl/p-Si Heterojunction Optoelectronic Logic Gates.'}"
"Hair cosmetic products contain various chemicals which are partly potent contact sensitizers. These may cause occupational hand eczema in hairdressers, but also scalp and face dermatitis in consumers. To (i) highlight differences between the spectrum of occupational and non-occupational exposure reflected in sensitization, and (ii) correlate trends in the last decades with regulatory interventions (or the lack thereof). Patch test and clinical data collected by the IVDK (https://www.ivdk.org) between 01/1995 and 12/2020 were subjected to a pooled re-analysis. Age-stratified sensitization prevalences in female hairdressers and consumers, respectively, were calculated for 2-yearly intervals spanning the study period. Log-binomial regression models were employed to estimate the association between contact allergy and (i) subgroup (hairdresser vs. consumer), (ii) a 3-level age category, and/or (iii) time period, respectively. Hair dyes were the most frequent sensitizers in hairdressers and consumers; however, there was a marked increase in (particularly the young) consumers. Pyrogallol had been banned in 1992 but still elicited positive patch test reactions even in the young. Hydroquinone, banned in 2013 in dyes, showed no decline in sensitization prevalence. Glyceryl thioglycolate has been withdrawn and later banned in Germany since around 1995, which caused contact allergy prevalence to drop to almost zero in the youngest age group, largely until today. As a limitation, putatively differing selection for patch testing render prevalences difficult to compare between hairdressers and consumers. The importance of hair dye allergy is evident, needing continued efforts to increase product safety from the manufacturing and regulatory side.

"Inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis (PsO), atopic dermatitis (AD), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and alopecia areata (AA), are chronic immune-mediated disorders that substantially impair the quality of life and impose a growing socioeconomic burden. In Latin America (LA), these conditions unfold in the context of structural inequality, fragmented health systems, and limited epidemiological data. Our objective was to review the epidemiology, awareness, and treatment landscape of PsO, AD, HS, and AA in Latin America, highlighting regional guidelines, real-world studies, and unmet needs. A narrative review was performed by integrating data from peer-reviewed publications, national and regional guidelines, registry analyses, and real-world studies published until 2025. The prevalence of PsO in LA ranges from 0.5% to 2%, AD affects 2-3% of adults, HS prevalence is estimated at 0.3-0.5%, and AA lifetime risk approximates 1-2%. Across conditions, awareness among patients and non-specialists remains low, contributing to delayed diagnosis and undertreatment. National guidelines, recently updated in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, broadly align with international standards, adapting recommendations to local resource and reimbursement constraints. Biologic and targeted therapies have transformed disease management; however, access remains inequitable, limited by high costs, fragmented insurance systems, and slow regulatory approval processes. Emerging real-world evidence from registries such as MEASURE-AD, RENAAC (AA), and national HS cohorts confirms therapeutic benefit but highlights persistent disparities and data gaps. Despite major advances in therapeutic innovation, LA faces continuing inequities in access and outcomes for inflammatory skin diseases.

"Nemolizumab provides rapid and effective relief from pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis. However, it is frequently associated with cutaneous adverse events, and reliable predictors of their severity have not yet been clearly identified. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of nemolizumab-associated cutaneous adverse events and patients' clinical background and to explore baseline factors that may be useful in predicting their severity.We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 patients with atopic dermatitis who received nemolizumab between May 2023 and March 2025. Clinical variables included demographics, prior therapies, phenotype, baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index subscores, serum biomarker levels, and treatment courses. The severity of cutaneous adverse events was classified as mild (<10% body surface area or limited to dryness/desquamation) or moderate-to-severe (&#x2265;10% body surface area).Cutaneous adverse events occurred in 31 of 40 patients (78%); 13 were moderate-to-severe and 18 were mild. Most events appeared within 16 weeks of treatment initiation. Severity was associated with age, duration of disease, serum Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC) level, and clinical phenotype. Patients with trunk-dominant phenotypes showed more severe cutaneous adverse events than patients with extremity-dominant or prurigo-type atopic dermatitis. Most cutaneous adverse events resolved within 12 weeks using topical therapy, without requiring treatment discontinuation.Baseline characteristics such as age, duration of disease, serum TARC levels, and severity of trunk lesions may be useful in predicting the risk of severe cutaneous adverse events, supporting their potential use in pre-treatment assessment and patient counseling.",Akiko,Sugiyama,Sugiyama Akiko; Nakahara Takeshi; Kojima Kaoru; Nishie Haruko; Nishimura Miku; Hiramoto Tetsuya,10.3390/jcm14248657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema","Real-World, Single-Center Analysis of Cutaneous Adverse Events with Nemolizumab: Toward Safer and More Effective Use."

"Background The aim of this study is to characterise dupilumab-associated ocular surface disease (DAOSD) and its management in the paediatric population. Methods Retrospective data were obtained from the electronic medical records of a tertiary Australian paediatric public hospital's Ophthalmology department for patients reviewed between 1 January 2021 and 1 December 2024. Demographic information was recorded, including gender, age when dupilumab was started, ethnicity, dupilumab indication, past medical history, and baseline serology testing. Clinical characteristics collected included presenting visual acuity (VA), ophthalmological findings, ocular treatment, time to onset and resolution of DAOSD, and final ophthalmological outcome. Cessation of dupilumab due to DAOSD was also noted. Results A total of 13 patients were identified with DAOSD. The mean time from starting dupilumab to onset of DAOSD was 24 weeks (7.3-97.9 weeks). The mean time from onset of ocular symptoms to ophthalmology review was 3.6 weeks (range 0.1-8). The mean baseline VA was logMAR 0.01 (range 0-0.3). Ophthalmological examination findings included conjunctival injection (n=9, 69%), papillary reaction (n=5, 39%), superficial punctate keratitis (n=5, 39%), limbitis (n=3, 23%), and periocular involvement (n=2, 14%). Management included lubricant eye drops (n=13, 100%), topical steroid drops (n=9, 80%), topical antihistamines/mast cell stabiliser eye drops (n=5, 39%), and systemic azithromycin (n=1, 8%). The mean final VA was logMAR 0.06 (range 0-0.3). Three (23%) patients discontinued dupilumab due to ocular or systemic side effects. Conclusions Early ophthalmological assessment and intervention can lead to positive final visual outcomes in paediatric patients experiencing DAOSD. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of DAOSD treatment in the paediatric population.",Vivien,Nguyen,Nguyen Vivien; Zhang Susan; Dai Shuan,10.7759/cureus.97878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Clinical Outcomes of Dupilumab-Associated Ocular Surface Disease in the Paediatric Population.

"Recent literature has highlighted an association between severe atopic dermatitis in infancy and biochemical disturbances consistent with secondary hyperaldosteronism. Trans-epidermal sodium loss driving volume depletion has been hypothesised to contribute to this process, but direct evidence of the underlying mechanisms remains sparse. We present a case series of three children, aged three to seven months, who were admitted with severe exudative eczema associated with hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, despite evidence of effective RAAS activation and renal mineralocorticoid action. In each case, these biochemical and hormonal disturbances resolved after optimising dermatological and nutritional management of their atopic presentations, supporting the role of extra-renal mechanisms of electrolyte disturbance. Our case series highlights the importance of considering biochemical and hormonal factors in comprehensive, early treatment of infantile atopic dermatitis to prevent complications associated with electrolyte imbalances and nutritional deficiencies.",Aim&#xe9;e M M C,Jacquemot,Jacquemot Aim&#xe9;e M M C; Taylor David R; Melhem Nabil; Derrick Emily; Kapoor Ritika R,10.6065/apem.2550320.160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with severe infantile atopic dermatitis: a case series.
"To evaluate efficacy and safety of abrocitinib and dupilumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). A retrospective analysis of 104 patients with moderate-to-severe AD (January-June 2023) was conducted. Patients received either oral abrocitinib 200&#x2009;mg/day (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51) or subcutaneous dupilumab 300&#x2009;mg every 2&#x2009;weeks (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;53, baseline load 600&#x2009;mg) for 24&#x2009;weeks. At 4, 8, and 12&#x2009;weeks posttreatment, patients in the abrocitinib group exhibited significantly lower Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores compared to the dupilumab group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Additionally, patients in the abrocitinib group demonstrated significantly lower Numeric Rating Scale for Pruritus (P-NRS) scores at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24&#x2009;weeks posttreatment compared to the dupilumab group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Furthermore, patients in the abrocitinib group showed significantly lower Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores at 4, 8, 12, and 16&#x2009;weeks posttreatment compared to the dupilumab group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). Compared with dupilumab group, EASI, P-NRS and DLQI levels in abrocitinib group were more significantly decreased. The incidence of conjunctivitis in dupilumab group was significantly higher than that in abrocitinib group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05). The incidence of nausea in abrocitinib group was significantly higher than that in dupilumab group (&#x2009;<&#x2009;.05).

"Recent advances in immunology and transcriptomics have transformed dermatology, redefining inflammatory skin diseases as distinct molecular entities characterized by dominant immune pathways such as Th17, Th2, Th1, type I interferon (IFN) and myeloid modules. We transcriptionally delineated these immune modules, constructed a reference immune cartography to map patient skin biopsies and developed a digital platform that enables clinicians to analyse individual molecular profiles, facilitating precise diagnosis for clinically overlapping or diagnostically ambiguous dermatoses. Beyond diagnostic utility, this platform supports therapeutic decision-making by aligning each patient's dominant immune module with the most appropriate targeted treatment. Analyses of treatment failures reveal that discordance between therapy and immune module dominance, as well as immune shifts between modules, account for most cases of non-response. Realigning therapy with the patient's molecular profile restores efficacy and enables rational adaptation or repurposing of existing agents. By integrating molecular diagnostics with immune module-guided therapy, this approach establishes a precision medicine framework that optimizes outcomes and advances personalized care for patients with inflammatory skin disease.",Jeremy,Di Domizio,Di Domizio Jeremy; Girardin Antoine; Conrad Curdin; Seremet Teofila; Gilliet Michel,10.1111/jdv.70251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Dermatology 2.0: Precision medicine for inflammatory skin diseases.

"This integrative literature review, conducted with a systematic approach, examined how a child's atopic dermatitis affects parental functioning. Fifty-four studies have been reviewed, identifying the key impacts, including work absenteeism, reduced quality of life, increased distress, sleep deprivation, and challenges in parent-child relationships. These dimensions were grouped into three focuses: Parents as workers, individuals, and caregivers. The review found that atopic dermatitis often disrupts parents' careers, causes emotional strain, family burden, and sleep issues. Parent-child interactions may also be affected, potentially impacting the attachment bond. Overall, the findings highlighted the interconnected nature of parental experiences and stressed the need to consider all family members' perspectives.

Outcomes included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) H&N subscore, erythema grade, patient-reported measures, and adverse events.: Dupilumab shows substantial efficacy for HND in both clinical trials and real-life studies; however, responses are often less pronounced than in other anatomical regions, and facial redness (FR) has emerged as a notable adverse event in up to 9% of patients. Tralokinumab and lebrikizumab demonstrate significant improvements in HND involvement, with low incidence of paradoxical reactions. JAK inhibitors, particularly upadacitinib, provide rapid and marked improvement in refractory cases and in patients developing FR during biologic therapy.: Systemic therapy for HND should be individualized, balancing efficacy and tolerability.

"The objective of the study is to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and influencing factors of hand eczema (HE) among nursing staff in certain regions of Xinjiang during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing staff from one tertiary hospital, one secondary hospital, and 15 community hospitals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region were selected as subjects. Clinical data of all participants were collected using paper questionnaires from November 2022 to March 2023, and the incidence and influencing factors of HE were analyzed. A total of 218 (26.3%) cases of HE were identified. The incidence in surgical departments (30.6%) was higher than that in non-surgical departments (24.1%, &#x3c7;= 3.951, p = 0.047). The incidence in the 20-30 age group (22.2%) was lower than that in the 31-40 age group (30.7%, &#x3c7;= 6.57, p = 0.01) and the 51-60 age group (39.3%, &#x3c7;= 4.29, p = 0.04). The incidence was significantly lower in the group with hand cleaning frequency of 0-5 times per day (12.1%) compared to the groups with 6-10 times per day (26.3%, &#x3c7;= 5.095, p = 0.024), 11-20 times per day (25.9%, &#x3c7;= 5.157, p = 0.023), and >20 times per day (29.9%, &#x3c7;= 7.745, p = 0.005). Similarly, the incidence increased with the frequency of soap/hand sanitizer exposure. The incidence was lower in the group using moisturizer more than 10 times per day (15.5%) compared to those using it 3-5 times per day (27.0%, &#x3c7;= 5.786, p = 0.016) and less than three times per day (36.3%, &#x3c7;= 16.344, p < 0.001). No significant differences in HE incidence were found among groups divided based on the frequency of daily contact with alcohol-based hand rub or the duration of rubber glove use (p > 0.05). The incidence of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, metal allergy, and dry skin was higher in the HE group than in the non-HE group (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analyses showed that age, years of working experience, presence of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, metal allergy, daily handwashing frequency, and frequency of contacting soap/hand sanitizer were risk factors for developing HE, while moisturizer use was a protective factor. The incidence of HE among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high and was associated with hand hygiene practices and the patients' atopic constitution.

"Whether atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with an altered susceptibility to contact sensitization (CS) remains debated. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated estimates of the association between AD and CS overall, by population type (general or referred), various demographics and selected allergens. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies published between 2016 and 2025 reporting CS prevalence in individuals with and without AD. Data were combined with a previous systematic review covering studies published between 1982 and 2016. Meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). The pooled analyses showed no overall association between AD and CS (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.82-1.42), including in referred populations (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.76-1.38). In general population studies, CS prevalence was higher among individuals with AD. The association was statistically significant in children and adolescents (OR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.0-1.80) but not in adults. Positive associations were found between AD and CS to Compositae mix and sesquiterpene lactone mix, but not to nickel, cobalt, or chromium.

"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the skin and is characterized by intense pruritus and eczema. It requires systemic therapies and the use of novel treatments, such as Dupilumab and Janus kinase inhibitors. The approval of these drugs has revolutionized treatment during the last years. We present a case of a patient with severe atopic dermatitis, refractory to immunosuppressive treatment and his evolution after starting treatment with monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are advanced and novel therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

"This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of atopic eczema (AE) in children/adolescents and adults and variables associated with risk factors. We used data from a cross-sectional, population-based study performed in six cities of Colombia during 2009-2010. A nested case-control study was used to determine AE-associated risk factors. In adults, AE was mainly associated with a family history of AE (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.66, 95%IC:3.18 to 6.82) and Allergic Rhinitis (AR) (aOR 2.21, 95%CI: 1.61 to 3.03). We also found a dose-dependent positive association between acetaminophen use and AE, being more assertive at once per week (aOR 2.12, 95%CI: 1.47 to 3.06) than once per month (aOR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.28 to 2.59). Female gender (aOR 1.49, 95%CI: 1.15 to 1.93), smoking (aOR 1.60, 95%CI: 1.19 to 2.14), and cats at home (aOR 1.57, 95%CI: 1.06 to 2.31), were positively associated with AE. In contrast, meat (aOR 0.45, 95%CI: 0.27 to 0.74), and seafood consumption (aOR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.56 to 0.91) were negatively associated. In children/adolescents, family history of AR (aOR 2.97, 95%CI: 1.79 to 4.93) and acetaminophen consumption once per week (aOR 4.00, 95%CI: 1.39 to 11.50) were associated with AE.

"Prolonged mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an increase in dermatologic conditions, particularly irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. Mechanical friction, occlusion, and humidity contribute to skin barrier disruption and inflammation. Although most cases are self-limiting, a subset may evolve into chronic or steroid-dependent dermatoses. We report a case of a 23-year-old male healthcare professional who developed erythematous plaques behind the ear following continuous mask use. The lesions initially responded to topical betamethasone 0.05% cream but relapsed after tapering, evolving into chronic seborrheic inflammation with pruritus and scaling extending into the scalp and external auditory canal. Application of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and fusidic acid cream aggravated the condition, reflecting persistent inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Clinical findings indicated steroid dependence and chronic seborrheic-type inflammation. Barrier-restoring measures and cautious corticosteroid withdrawal led to gradual improvement. This case highlights the multifactorial pathogenesis of chronic mask-related dermatitis and underscores the importance of barrier repair, prudent corticosteroid use, and interdisciplinary collaboration in managing persistent cases.",Mohammed,Bin Rakan,Bin Rakan Mohammed; Rakan Maha; Bin Rakan Ibrahim,10.7759/cureus.97095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Mask-Induced Dermatitis Progressing to Chronic Seborrheic Inflammation: A Case Report.
"In 2023, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI)/American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force (JTF) updated their guidelines for management of atopic dermatitis from their last update in 2012. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) also updated their own guidelines from 2014 for the diagnosis, assessment, safety, and efficacy of treatments in 2024. In this review, we outline the key changes from the prior guidelines and highlight the major differences between the two recommendations. The majority of the guidelines and recommendations are similar in their overall recommendations with small stylistic differences including application frequency and combination of therapies. Key differences between the two recommendations include topical PDE-4 Inhibitors, topical JAK Inhibitors, systemic JAK inhibitors, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. The final difference between the AAD and JTF guidelines is that AAD categorizes evidence and comments on the certainty of association for each group of comorbidities, while JTF makes general statements regarding comorbidities.",Dharm,Sodha,Sodha Dharm; Patel Atithi; Lio Peter,41416235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Updates from the AAD and AAAAI Guidelines for Managing Atopic Dermatitis.
"Chronic pruritus significantly impacts quality of life and remains challenging to manage, particularly in patients unresponsive to systemic therapies. Nemolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin (IL)-31 receptor, has shown promise in alleviating pruritus across several dermatologic conditions. However, data on its efficacy in treatment-resistant cases, particularly in real-world settings, remain limited. This case series evaluates the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in patients with treatment-resistant chronic pruritus. A multicenter retrospective review was conducted across private dermatology practices and large academic dermatology centers. Patient records were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, treatment history, and clinical outcomes, including Body Surface Area (BSA), Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS). Adverse events were recorded. Twelve patients (5 with atopic dermatitis, 2 with prurigo nodularis, 3 with chronic pruritus of unknown origin, and 2 with concomitant atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) were included. All had previously failed systemic therapies. Mean baseline BSA was 45 percent (range 5-88%), with mean PP-NRS of 9 (range 6-10). After treatment, mean BSA and PP-NRS decreased to 4 percent (11-fold reduction) and 0.9 (10-fold reduction), respectively. Most (10/12) experienced significant pruritus relief within 24 to 72 hours of nemolizumab initiation. No serious adverse events were noted, including in patients with a history of malignancy or end-stage renal disease. Small sample size, retrospective design, limited follow-up, and absence of a control group.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense itching, redness, and eczema. It significantly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals, often requiring long-term management strategies. Abrocitinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Phase 2 and phase 3 abrocitinib randomized clinical trials in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) clinical development program have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in both adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. This review article explores the benefit-risk profile of a flexible abrocitinib dosing approach, tailoring dose based on individualized treatment of patients and highlighting the available supportive data from the JADE randomized clinical trials for healthcare professionals as part of joint provider-patient decision&#xa0;making. Dosing flexibility and maintenance with the lowest effective dose is necessary to treat patients according to their individual disease course while minimizing safety risks. Safety data indicate that incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events is reflective of the current dosage, with no carry-over risk from a previous higher dosage. Overall, abrocitinib represents a valuable AD therapy that can be administered according to individual patient needs.Graphical abstract available for this article.",Jonathan I,Silverberg,Silverberg Jonathan I; Simpson Eric; Gooderham Melinda; Weidinger Stephan; Watkins Melissa; Alderfer Justine,10.1007/s13555-025-01618-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Tailoring Abrocitinib Treatment for Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis to Patient Disease Course: A Narrative Review.
"Children and young people (CYP) living with skin conditions, experience significant psychological burden, which has been well-documented. Guidance has been produced to help support clinicians address this (McPherson T, Ravenscroft J, Ali R et al. British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Dermatology assessment and support of mental health in children and young people with skin conditions: a multidisciplinary expert consensus statement and recommendations. Br J Dermatol 2023;189:459-66). The guidance stresses the importance of routinely asking about impact on psychosocial health and documenting this in communications. We audited clinic letters at our tertiary Dermatology Centre from 2013-2025 in CYP who have been prescribed systemic medications for eczema or psoriasis to assess if this is addressed and documented in clinic correspondence. 540 clinic letters from 47 CYP (age range 5 months-22 years) with eczema (n = 37) or psoriasis (n = 10), were examined. 80.2% of clinic letters had mental health impact and/ or quality of life (QoL) impact documented in some form. This was most commonly recorded using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and a comment (58.0%), followed by a comment only (27.5%) and PROM only (14.8%). Examples of mental health impact comments included decreased self-confidence, isolation, decreased mood during flares and sleep disturbance frequently due to pruritus. 18/47 patients were documented to be under CAMHS and 14 were referred to Psychological Medicine Service for skin condition related psychological support. Improvement in disease specific scores (EASI, POEM, PASI) did relate to improvement in QOL scores (CDLQI and TQoL) and reported psychological benefits such as improved sleep and mood. This data confirms that severe inflammatory skin conditions have a high mental health burden. Reassuringly this is generally being discussed in clinic and recorded in communications as part of ongoing assessment.",Daniela,Krouzkova,Krouzkova Daniela; McPherson Tess,10.1093/bjd/ljaf465.020,,,Psoriasis,"Dermatitis, Atopic",,,,drug therapy; psychology,drug therapy; psychology,therapeutic use,,,Humans,Child,Adolescent,Psoriasis,Quality of Life,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",P12 An audit of the psychological morbidity of children and young people on systemic medications for atopic eczema or psoriasis.
"Eczema patients and their carers often have questions where there is no good evidence base to advise them. Rapid Eczema Trials is a 5-year programme delivering efficient online studies on topics prioritised by patients/carers. Through online surveys and co-design meetings, the eczema community have co-designed clinical trials. The randomised controlled trials are delivered entirely remotely so anyone in the UK can take part. For 4 weeks participants aged 1+ bathe daily (bath or shower 6 or more times a week) or bathe weekly (bath or shower 1 or 2 times a week) to see if it makes a difference to eczema symptoms (assessed using POEM). For 4 months participants aged 1+ are given specific advice (use steroids for 2 days after an eczema flare) or treat-as-usual advice. For 4 months participants aged 8+ are given a behaviour change intervention targeting the itch-scratch cycle or treat-as-usual advice. The Bathing Study recruited 438 participants and found no significant difference in POEM scores (adjusted mean difference of -0.4 points, 95_msocom_2% CI -1.3 to 0.4, P = 0.30).The Keep Control Study is currently recruiting and the Scratch Less Study is in set-up.

"Eczema, an itchy skin condition, affects up to 20% of children. Habitual scratching/chronic itch-scratch cycle promotes inflammation, infection, affects sleep and causes psycho-social distress. Habit reversal has been used to reduce scratching and improve eczema but randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence is limited, particularly in children, and no RCTs have utilised virtual interventions. The Kids in Control (KIC) MDT team was awarded a UKDCTN themed research grant to develop and assess the acceptability, usability, and feasability of a virtual behavioural intervention for children aged 8-12 with itchy eczema. Existing educational and intervention materials were refined to a virtual 3 part programme designed to increase eczema understanding, scratching awareness and change scratching behaviour. Using the person based approach to intervention development a bespoke KIC website was built and parents/children were invited to participate in qualitative think-aloud interviews (nationally via Eczema Outreach Support and National Eczema Society) designed to ensure the intervention was acceptable, meaningful, and optimally engaging. A balanced group of 8 children/parents participated in individual, transcribed think aloud interviews and then a table of changes and thematic analysis was completed. Key themes explored were engaging material, willingness to try it, self efficacy, relatability, eczema impact, parent facilitation and understanding the material. Key changes were made and the modified KIC was explored in a transcribed virtual focus group of 4 children/parents. Analysis of key themes enabled further changes resulting in a 3 part optimally engaging virtual behaviour intervention programme ready for further evaluation in a trial setting.",Susannah,Baron,Baron Susannah; Ali Rukshana; Akinde Maria; Kanji Alpa; Dobson Amy; Flohr Carsten; Cheung Carrie; Muller Ingrid,10.1093/bjd/ljaf465.002,,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Pruritus,Behavior Therapy,,,psychology; therapy; complications,therapy; prevention & control; etiology; psychology,methods,methods,psychology; education,Humans,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Child,Pruritus,Female,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",O02 Kids in control: development and assessment of a 3 part virtual behavioural intervention programme to reduce scratching in children with atopic eczema.

"Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in atopic dermatitis (AD), affecting both type (T)1 and T2 immune pathways. An anti-IL-18 monoclonal antibody, aletekitug, was evaluated for its clinical and molecular effects in patients with moderate to severe AD. This randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 24-week study assessed adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were biologic-na&#xef;ve or dupilumab-inadequate responders/intolerant. Participants received a single intravenous (IV) infusion of aletekitug 2&#x2009;mg/kg or placebo. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline (PCFB) in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at Week 12. Other endpoints included safety, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and transcriptomics. Thirty-four participants (aletekitug, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23; placebo, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) were randomised. A greater reduction in the PCFB in EASI score at Week 12 was demonstrated for patients who received aletekitug versus placebo (posterior median PCFB [95% credible intervals]: aletekitug, -68.3% [-79.68, -56.68]; placebo, -32.9% [-45.74, -21.10]), with effects still apparent at Week 24. Aletekitug improved PRO measures of itch, sleep disturbance, fatigue and quality of life versus placebo up to Week 24. Transcriptome analysis suggested aletekitug modulated lesional skin towards a non-lesional profile and exerted broad immunomodulatory effects, impacting several AD-associated signalling pathways, not limited to T2 immunity. Aletekitug was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. A single 2&#x2009;mg/kg IV dose of aletekitug was associated with improved outcomes at Week 12, which were sustained to Week 24, and modulated immune mechanisms beyond T2 inflammation.

"Advancing age is associated with an increasing prevalence of dry skin conditions such as xerosis, asteatotic eczema and atopic dermatitis (AD). Although broad changes in stratum corneum (SC) lipids and AD history have been implicated, age-related alterations in the SC lipidome within at-risk populations remain unclear. We characterised SC structure and lipidomic profiles in 58 adults with dry, eczema-prone skin across a wide age range. Assessments included visual dryness, biophysical properties (TEWL, capacitance, skin-surface-pH), irritant sensitivity, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and lipidomic analysis through quantification of extracted SC lipids via mass spectrometry. Age correlated significantly with increased dryness (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.0001) and reduced hydration (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.42, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.0001).

Among 1385 quantified lipid species, triacylglycerol (TAG) was most abundant; TAG 46:1;0 associated with dryness (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.42, p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.0001). Ceramides CER[AH] (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001), CER[AP] (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001), CER[AdS] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042), CER[NP] (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.031) and CER[NdS] (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001) all significantly increased with age relative to protein. Notably, CER[NdS] species shifted towards shorter (16&#xba;C) acyl chains (+2.23%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and away from longer (24&#xba;C) chains (-3.9%, p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.0001).

"Cholesterol-lowering medications (CLMs) are used globally. Cholesterol is a key stratum corneum lipid that helps maintain epidermal barrier integrity. Barrier dysfunction contribute to pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). Clarifying whether CLMs impact AD has implications for dermatology and cardiology. We synthesized evidence from experimental, clinical, and genetic epidemiology through targeted literature searches and expert selections. It focuses on 1) skin barrier biology and epidermal cholesterol metabolism, and 2) potential effect of CLMs on AD. We discuss findings from experimental studies comparing topical versus systemic statins; population-based observations of AD among CLM users; and Mendelian randomization analyses of CLMs. Effect of CLMs on AD is biologically plausible but clinically unproven. Signals of concern are most consistent for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) inhibition, whereas Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition appears protective in some populations. Current studies are limited by confounding, heterogeneous outcomes and sparse ancestry-specific analyses. Until robust causal and pharmacoepidemiologic studies across ancestries are available, clinicians should prioritize established cardiovascular benefit of lipid reduction while monitoring for new or worsening dermatitis after therapy initiation. Future work should triangulate Mendelian randomization with pharmacoepidemiology designs in large, diverse datasets to deliver definitive guidance.",John,Tetteh,Tetteh John; Yiu Zenas Z N,10.1080/17512433.2025.2606262,,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Anticholesteremic Agents,,,,chemically induced; epidemiology; etiology,adverse effects; administration & dosage; pharmacology,metabolism,adverse effects; administration & dosage; pharmacology,,Humans,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Anticholesteremic Agents,Cholesterol,Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Is there a link between cholesterol-lowering medications and atopic dermatitis?
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) involves chronic eczema resulting from barrier dysfunction. Fine bubble (FB) technology generates microbubbles (<&#x2009;100&#x2009;&#x3bc;m) and ultrafine bubbles (<&#x2009;1&#x2009;&#x3bc;m) for surfactant-sparing cleansing. We assessed the short-term safety of an FB shower in AD. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, adults with mild AD completed two 2-week periods separated by a 2-week washout in sequence. Bathing instructions and petrolatum moisturizer use were standardized and enforced. The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) was scored using whole-body photographs by a blinded team. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration were measured on Days 0, 14, and 28. Because baselines were unavailable for the second 2-week period, the primary analysis compared Day 0-14 changes between groups using baseline-adjusted analysis of covariance; Day 0-28 changes were also explored. The primary outcomes were EASI changes; TEWL and hydration were the secondary outcomes. Groups used a conventional shower (control) first and then FB shower second or vice versa (once each). Twenty-three participants were analyzed (mean age 40.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8&#x2009;years; 83% male). Day 0-14 EASI changes did not differ between FB and control (0.62&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.21 vs. 0.05&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.68; F&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.93, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.35). EASI changes to Day 28 were nonsignificant (0.02&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.65 vs. -0.03&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.02; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.90). TEWL changes for Days 0-14 (0.31&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.75 vs. 1.09&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.21&#x2009;g/m/h) and to Day 28 (5.49&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;14.43 vs. -0.27&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.28&#x2009;g/m/h) showed no between-group differences.

"There is a paucity of data regarding the use of Janus kinase inhibitors in elderly patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis necessitating systemic therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib compared with dupilumab in atopic dermatitis patients aged 60 years or older. A single-centre, non-randomized controlled trial (ChiCTR2300077724) was conducted from December 2022 to March 2024, in which 58 patients were assigned to receive either abrocitinib (100 mg daily) or dupilumab (600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a &#x2265;&#x2009;4-point reduction in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) at Week 2 and the proportion achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 at Week 12; EASI-90 response at Week 24 was a key secondary endpoint. Results showed that a higher proportion of patients receiving abrocitinib achieved a PP-NRS4 response at Week 2 (52% vs 26%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.046). At Week 12, EASI-75 response rates were similar between the 2 groups (45% for abrocitinib vs 44% for dupilumab; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.95). By Week 24, the EASI-90 response rate was 52% in the abrocitinib group compared with 41% in the dupilumab group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4). Adverse events in the abrocitinib group included colon tumour (3%), nausea (6%), folliculitis (6%), and headache (16%), while the dupilumab group reported T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (3%) and conjunctivitis (7%).

"Dupilumab is a known treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD). However, there is limited data on the effectiveness and safety of its use within the paediatric population. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness and safety of dupilumab in children under 16&#x2009;years with moderate-to-severe AD. 162 children aged 6&#x2009;months to 16&#x2009;years with moderate-to-severe AD were treated with dupilumab. Dupilumab was accessed through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for those aged 12 and above. Those aged under 12&#x2009;years accessed dupilumab with applications to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Special Access Scheme (SAS) as a category B application. Such applications were then processed through the hospital pharmacy as an individual patient approval (IPA). Treatment was surveyed over a 3-year period from 2020 to 2023. Treatment effect was determined by overall clinical disease severity with the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. Scores were repeated at serial appointments following dupilumab doses. All data were collected from a single Australian tertiary referral paediatric hospital and tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet. A significant improvement was observed for almost all patients, with 87% achieving at least a 75% reduction in EASI scores. Adverse effects occurred in 30% of patients, although these were mostly minor and transient. Only four patients (2.4%) ceased dupilumab due to adverse effects or failure to respond.

"Ivarmacitinib (SHR0302) has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profiles in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of ivarmacitinib on the extent and severity of moderate-to-severe AD across anatomical regions. A post-hoc analysis was performed based on the data from a phase III trial of ivarmacitinib (NCT04875169). Patients receiving ivarmacitinib or placebo were included in this study. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score was assessed in four regions, including the head/neck, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities. EASI 75/90/100 response was defined as &#x2265;&#x2009;75.0%/90.0%/100.0% improvement in EASI score from baseline. There were 112, 113, and 111 patients in the ivarmacitinib 8&#xa0;mg, ivarmacitinib 4&#xa0;mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Reductions in EASI scores from baseline for four regions (head/neck, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities) were greater in the ivarmacitinib 8&#xa0;mg and 4&#xa0;mg groups than in the placebo group at week (W) 1 and sustained until W16. Higher response rates of EASI 100, 90, and 75 across four regions were also observed in ivarmacitinib 8&#xa0;mg and 4&#xa0;mg groups versus the placebo group at W4, W8, W12 and W16. Moreover, most of the reductions in EASI erythema, edema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification scores from baseline to W16 across four regions were greater in the ivarmacitinib 8&#xa0;mg and 4&#xa0;mg groups than in the placebo group.

"Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody&#xa0;systemic therapy approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). It works by blocking the signaling pathways of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). This case report&#xa0;describes a 10-year-old male with severe AD who developed&#xa0;myalgia and enthesitis suspected to be induced by dupilumab. The patient developed severe myalgia after a month of being on dupilumab, although his eczematous skin rash showed considerable improvement after treatment initiation. His pain was restricting movement and leading to contractures, which made him unable to walk or stand independently. A thorough diagnostic workup, which included rheumatological, brain, and spine imaging studies, was done to exclude other possible causes. Treatment with dupilumab was stopped, and the patient was advised to undergo physiotherapy and serial casting to restore his muscle function and for the correction of contractures. While dupilumab&#xa0;is regarded as a safe and well-tolerated medication, this report illustrates uncommon adverse effects of the drug that are rarely described in the pediatric population and may contribute to considerable morbidity. A probable underlying mechanism may involve an interaction between the IL-4/IL-13 axis and the IL-17/IL-23 axis, which also play a role in autoimmune arthritis. The report focuses on the significance of close monitoring for musculoskeletal symptoms in patients receiving dupilumab and emphasizes the need for prompt drug discontinuation if such manifestations occur.",Mohamad,Sabsabee,Sabsabee Mohamad; Salman Alaa; Alketbi Sheikha; Al Hamdani Mustafa; Nasreldien Ali,10.7759/cureus.96773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Dupilumab-Induced Myalgia and Enthesitis in a Pediatric Patient Treated for Severe Atopic Dermatitis.
"Although cognitive and behavioral factors significantly impact dermatological outcomes, psychobehavioral interventions remain inaccessible and underused. To develop and test a psychobehavioral intervention (MindMySkin) delivered via a mobile application. Needs assessment, evidence-based module development, and formative user-centered evaluation were conducted in participants with eczema, psoriasis, or chronic urticaria. The developed prototype modules were further iteratively refined following additional qualitative and quantitative feedback. 27 participants contributed to 24 1:1 interviews and 231 responses between June 2023 and November 2024. Modules were highly rated (median score 4 or 5/5) for utility, interest, understandability, and recommendation for inclusion, underscoring strong acceptability. Participants valued the informative content and conversational tone but highlighted skepticism toward reflection exercises and oversimplification of patient difficulties. Design challenges include balancing time demanding but effective modules with shorter more appealing content. The final intervention comprised 74 modules addressing illness coherence, symptom management, functional impairment, emotional impairment, and the patient-physician relationship. No participant reviewed the full program and modules were assigned, limiting insights on voluntary adherence.

"Head and neck atopic dermatitis (HNAD) is a clinically common subtype of AD. While dupilumab is widely used in AD treatment, its efficacy in HNAD is debatable. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of dupilumab in HNAD. A retrospective study included 29 individuals with HNAD (17 adults and 12 pediatric patients) who were treated with dupilumab. Primary variables, including the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Visual Analog Scale for Itch (VAS-Itch), and Visual Analog Scale for Sleep Quality (VAS-SQ), were evaluated at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 16.

"Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, classically defined by its eczematous lesions and relapsing course. However, growing evidence over the past decade has revealed that this disease is in fact far more heterogeneous than previously thought - both in its clinical manifestations and in the underlying molecular and immunological mechanisms. This short review explores the evolving conceptual framework used to analyze atopic dermatitis, encompassing clinical presentations (phenotypes), immune polarization profiles (immunotypes), and the background disease-related and context-related factors that shape them. The aim of this review is to highlight how such heterogeneity influences disease severity, progression, and therapeutic response, particularly in the context of increasingly personalized treatment strategies. By synthesizing accumulated scientific and clinical insights, this short review provides clinicians with a practical guide to navigating the complex spectrum of AD and its underlying therapeutic targets. Recognizing and interpreting this multidimensional variability is essential for understanding disease course and optimizing treatment selection.",Alvaro,Prados-Carmona,Prados-Carmona Alvaro; Husein-ElAhmed Husein; Navarro-Trivi&#xf1;o Francisco J; Ruiz-Villaverde Ricardo,10.1111/ddg.15991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Deciphering atopic dermatitis heterogeneity: a short review on the translational revolution from endotypes to immunotypes.
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) in early childhood is associated with microbial dysbiosis. Skin and nasal microbiomes have been linked to AD severity; this relationship has not yet been studied in an African cohort. Here, we aimed to explore how urban and rural stratification, disease severity, and inter-site bacterial overlap shape the skin and nasal microbiomes of South African children with AD. Children were recruited from urban Cape Town (CT) and rural Umtata (UM), South Africa. We profiled the skin and nasal microbiomes of 183 children (84 healthy controls and 99 with AD; ages 9-37 months), totaling 462 samples, including both lesional and non-lesional skin sites in children with AD, in a cross-sectional study design. Using 16S rRNA V4-V5 sequencing for its accessibility, we applied random forest (RF) models to classify AD status based on amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and analyzed microbiome composition and diversity by region. We found that RF models could predict AD status using both skin and nasal microbiomes (AUCs: skin&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.69-0.79; nasal&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.65), strongly driven by both Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. The correlations between skin and nasal microbiomes were significantly stronger in children with AD compared to controls, with higher correlations observed in rural UM (healthy r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.45 to AD r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67) compared to urban CT (healthy r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.27 to AD r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.65). The skin microbiome diversity was higher in children from rural UM with healthy skin than in those from urban CT (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). However, children with AD in both groups showed significant alterations in their microbiome, with those in rural UM exhibiting greater beta diversity changes (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001-0.002) than their urban CT counterparts (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002-0.349).

"Data on the long-term efficacy and safety of topical therapy for atopic dermatitis (AD) remain limited. This prospective cohort study included all children with AD who had their first visit to the Allergy Center at the National Center for Child Health and Development between December 2020 and September 2022. Participants were evaluated at enrollment, 6, and 12 months, and also monitored via questionnaires. We analyzed those with an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score &#x2265;7.1 and complete EASI data at both follow-up points. The primary endpoint was the proportion achieving &#x2265;75 % improvement in EASI from baseline (EASI-75) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included other clinical endpoints, QOL scores, and skin and ocular complications. Of 763 enrolled children, 107 had EASI &#x2265;7.1, and 77 (72.0 %) had complete follow-up data. Median age at enrollment was 57.0 months [quartile: 13.0-141.0], and 58.4 % were male. Fifty-three had moderate (7.1&#x2264;EASI&#x2264;21.0) AD, and 24 had severe to very severe (21.1&#x2264;EASI) AD. Only two children (2.6 %) required systemic therapy during the study period. Median EASI scores significantly improved from 14.8 at baseline to 0.8 at both 6 and 12 months (P < 0.001). EASI-75 was achieved by 80.5 % at 6 months and 85.7 % at 12 months. Other clinical endpoints, including POEM, pruritus and sleep-disturbance NRS, and QOL scores, were improved. New dermatologic complications were rare, and no ophthalmologic complications occurred.

"Disturbed iron metabolism has been described in chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory/immune activation. This study aimed to characterize iron status in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to examine its relationship with disease severity and quality of life. We prospectively enrolled 86 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Clinical assessments included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Blood samples were collected for hematologic parameters and iron-related biomarkers, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hepcidin. Associations between iron markers and clinical outcomes were evaluated using beta regression models with variable selection and stability analyses. Abnormalities in circulating iron biomarkers indicating iron deficiency were prevalent in patients with AD: 45% of patients had low Tsat (<20%), 37% low ferritin, and 26% reduced serum iron, despite largely normal hemoglobin. Patients with pro-inflammatory activation (as evidenced by elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) above 5 mg/L) displayed a pattern characterized by lower iron, Tsat and higher sTfR levels. In multivariable analyses, lower serum iron remained associated with worse DLQI scores, while higher transferrin was associated with greater disease severity (EASI, SCORAD). Iron deficiency without anemia was a common feature of moderate-to-severe AD and was associated with higher clinical burden.

"Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, posing a significant individual and healthcare burden. Traditionally managed with topical agents and broad immunosuppressants, the treatment landscape has shifted significantly in recent years. This review explores the transition from immunopathogenic understanding to personalized treatment strategies through advanced systemic therapies. We provide a thorough description of the current therapeutic arsenal, including approved monoclonal antibodies and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, as well as experimental agents under clinical investigation.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The OX40-OX40 ligand (OX40L) pathway has emerged as a novel therapeutic target. On this basis, three phase II clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different OX40-OX40L inhibitors (amlitelimab, rocatinlimab, and telazorlimab) in moderate-to-severe AD.

"Amlitelimab (SAR445229, KY1005), a nondepleting anti-OX40 ligand monoclonal antibody, reduced lesions and pruritus in phase&#xa0;2a and 2b trials in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Here, efficacy and durability of amlitelimab across body regions were evaluated, given that unmet needs remain for treatment of head and neck AD. STREAM-AD phase&#xa0;2b trial data were used in this post hoc analysis. Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive amlitelimab subcutaneously (250&#xa0;mg with 500-mg loading dose, 250&#xa0;mg, 125&#xa0;mg, or 62.5&#xa0;mg) or placebo every 4&#xa0;weeks from weeks&#xa0;0 to 24 (part&#xa0;1). In part&#xa0;2, clinical responders (patients achieving Investigator Global Assessment 0/1 and/or &#x2265;&#x2009;75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI-75] at week&#xa0;24) were re-randomized 3:1 to withdraw from amlitelimab or continue their pre-week&#xa0;24 amlitelimab dose through week&#xa0;52. EASI subscores and signs were evaluated for head and neck, trunk, lower extremities, and upper extremities. Part&#xa0;1 included 390 randomized patients; 190 continued to part&#xa0;2. In part&#xa0;1, all EASI body region subscores were reduced with all amlitelimab doses at week&#xa0;24 (P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.01). Additionally, the four EASI signs-erythema, edema, excoriation, and lichenification-were reduced with amlitelimab vs. placebo. Greater proportions of patients achieved EASI-75 per body region with all amlitelimab doses, compared to placebo (P&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05). At week&#xa0;52, clinical responders maintained improvements in each body region achieved in part&#xa0;1, regardless of treatment continuation or withdrawal. Improvements in AD signs and severity were observed with amlitelimab across all body regions. Notably, clinical responses were sustained following treatment withdrawal, supporting the potential for extended dosing intervals and durable off-treatment efficacy.

"Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) are monogenic disorders that predispose patients to infections, autoimmunity, atopy, and malignancies. Severe Th2-driven atopic dermatitis and asthma are common in several IEIs, including DOCK8 deficiency, STAT3 loss-of-function, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, often refractory to conventional therapies. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4R&#x3b1;, has shown promise in managing recalcitrant atopic dermatitis and asthma, but data in immunocompromised pediatric populations remain limited. We conducted a single-center, retrospective observational cohort study with prospective follow-up of ten pediatric patients with genetically confirmed IEI and atopic manifestations. Patients received subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg every 4 weeks for atopic dermatitis; every 2 weeks for severe asthma). Outcomes were assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), eosinophil counts, and infection frequency across four time points (baseline, 6 months, 12 months, >18 months). The cohort included ten patients (6 males, 4 females) with mutations in DOCK8 (n=5), CARD11 (n=2), STAT3 LOF (n=1), ADA (n=1), and PEPD (n=1). Of ten patients, nine received dupilumab for atopic dermatitis. Baseline EASI and DLQI scores were 34.33 and 25.0, respectively. Following dupilumab therapy, mean EASI decreased to 2.67 (p<0.001) and DLQI improved to 2.67 (p<0.001), with sustained response observed over 18 months. Peripheral eosinophil counts declined from 2.0&#xd7;10/L to 0.45&#xd7;10/L (p<0.001). One patient with severe asthma achieved C-ACT improvement from 10 to 26 with no subsequent exacerbations. Treatment was well-tolerated, with only mild conjunctivitis or transient hypereosinophilia reported. Notably, skin infections resolved, and no systemic or opportunistic infections were observed. Dupilumab is a safe and highly effective therapeutic option for pediatric patients with IEI-associated atopic manifestations, improving clinical outcomes, quality of life, and infection profile while preserving immune function. These findings support broader application of dupilumab in patients with IEI and warrant further investigation in larger, multicenter studies.",Najla,Alsediq,Alsediq Najla; Algholaiqa Thekra; Alnami Ghadah; AlJaber Abdulrahman N,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1715919,,,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized","Dermatitis, Atopic",Asthma,,,therapeutic use; adverse effects; administration & dosage,drug therapy; genetics; immunology; etiology,drug therapy; genetics; immunology,,,Humans,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized",Male,Female,Child,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Dupilumab for atopic manifestations in pediatric patients with inborn errors of immunity: efficacy and safety in a genetically diverse cohort.
"Lebrikizumab, a human monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-13, is approved for treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in many regions. However, real-world data are lacking and are needed to inform its efficacy and safety in broader populations. This retrospective study reviewed the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline and 16-20&#xa0;weeks of 84 consecutive patients who received lebrikizumab subcutaneously at the label dose in a tertiary centre. EASI scores were available at 16-20&#xa0;weeks for 72 patients. At this timepoint, 80.6% (58/72) achieved EASI&#xa0;50, 56.9% (41/72) reached EASI&#xa0;75, and 27.8% (20/72) attained EASI&#xa0;90. DLQI was reduced by an average of -&#x2009;1.5 points at 16-20&#xa0;weeks. No serious adverse events were reported. Ocular adverse events occurred in 21.4% of the cohort (18/84). Eleven out of 14 patients that previously experienced conjunctivitis with dupilumab or tralokinumab had no recurrence with lebrikizumab.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease affecting individuals across the lifespan from childhood through adulthood. The burden of AD is now well recognized. Recent advancements in understanding its pathophysiology have led to significant therapeutic improvements over the past five years. Dupilumab stands as one of the pioneering systemic treatments available for AD. While dupilumab enables rapid and substantial short-term disease control, assessing the effectiveness of long-term therapeutic strategies is crucial. Improving knowledge on the management of maintenance treatment is a key clinical question for patients and clinicians. We hypothesize that spacing dupilumab injections in adolescent and adult patients with controlled AD is an interesting maintenance treatment option. This randomized clinical trial aims to compare a step-down strategy involving spaced dupilumab injections with standard maintenance treatment in patients with controlled AD. This multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial will enroll 256 adolescents and adults with controlled AD treated with a labelled dose of dupilumab for at least 12&#xa0;months from thirty-one academic hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the experimental group (progressive step-down injection strategy) or the control group (standard maintenance treatment, i.e., 300&#xa0;mg dose administered every two weeks; for adolescents over the age of 12, the dose is adjusted according to weight). The primary outcome measure will be the Area under the Curve of the Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool score recorded weekly over one year. In clinical practice, AD patients who respond favorably to dupilumab often express interest in reducing treatment frequency, sometimes on their own initiative. Anticipated benefits of a step-down strategy include potentially improved long-term risk-benefit profiles and enhanced patient quality of life through reduced injection frequency. Collectively, this approach may yield insights into optimal long-term dupilumab strategies for responders while potentially lowering systemic treatment costs for healthcare providers.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common pediatric atopic disease and a risk factor for food allergy (FA) development. Children with AD are prone to developing allergic comorbidities. Its relationship with FA phenotype and timing of onset remains unclear. To evaluate associations between AD presence and onset timing with FA-related outcomes and atopic comorbidities. FORWARD is a longitudinal, multicenter study enrolling children younger than 12 years with physician-diagnosed FA between 2017 and 2024. Written informed consent was obtained. Data were collected from baseline survey and electronic medical records. Logistic regression models adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors assessed associations between AD with FA number, type of allergens, and atopic comorbidities. Among 1309 children with physician-diagnosed FA, 77% reported history of AD, with 30.3% between 1 and 3 months, 50.2% at 4 to 12 months, and 19.5% after 12 months. Multiple FAs, asthma, and allergic rhinitis were each associated with higher odds of AD. Late-onset AD was associated to lower odds of multiple FAs compared with early onset AD (odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.85), including lower odds of milk and egg allergies. Conversely, late-onset AD was associated with higher odds of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Among children with FAs, 77% report a history of AD, with more than 80% of children with FA developed AD within the first year of life. Children with multiple FAs and those with allergies to milk and egg are more likely to develop AD on earlier age onset, whereas asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with late-onset AD.",Hikma,Hussien,Hussien Hikma; Moore Donyea L; Nimri Sarah; Bilaver Lucy A; Warren Christopher M; Wlodarski Mark; Jiang Jialing; Assa'ad Amal H; Sharma Hemant P; Moy James N; Newmark Pamela; Fox Susan; Gupta Ruchi S; Mahdavinia Mahboobeh,10.1016/j.anai.2025.12.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",The age of eczema onset and multiple food allergies.

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction and inflammation.This study explored the relationship between Yes-associated protein (YAP) expression, autophagy, and skin barrier dysfunction in AD. Skin samples from AD patients and healthy controls were analyzed using mRNA-seq. Differential gene expression was visualized using ggplot2 and analyzed using GO and KEGG pathway analyses. An AD mouse model was created using house dust mite ointment, and HaCaT cells were treated to mimic AD inflammation. YAP expression was transfected with lentivirusand siRNA. Autophagy was induced with rapamycin. YAP levels were reduced in AD patients and correlated with filaggrin (FLG). YAP overexpression in mice improved skin lesions, enhanced barrier function (increased FLG, involucrin, and loricrin), and promoted autophagy (increased LC3-II/I; decreased p62 and p-mTOR). Similar effects were observed in cells, with increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. YAP knockdown reversed these effects, which were mitigated by rapamycin. Reduced YAP expression in AD is linked to inflammation and barrier dysfunction. YAP may improve AD by enhancing autophagy, reducing inflammation, and restoring skin barrier function.",Jinjing,Jia,Jia Jinjing; Ma Xin; Wang Tongfei; Ye Siqi; Yan Fenggen; Liu Junfeng; Li Hongyi; Chen Dacan; Mo Xiumei,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1681148,,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Autophagy,Skin,YAP-Signaling Proteins,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing",metabolism; pathology; immunology; genetics; etiology,metabolism; pathology; immunology,metabolism,genetics; metabolism,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Autophagy,Humans,Animals,Filaggrin Proteins,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",Yes-associated protein regulates autophagy to restore skin barrier function in atopic dermatitis.
"The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD were searched in the database of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, up to November 2024. The control group included placebo. The efficacy indicators were the percentage of patients achieving 50%, 75%, 90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index score (EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90) and the percentage of patients with an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Score of 0 or 1 from baseline until the time of efficacy observation, and the percent change in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), EASI score, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), and change in Percent Body Surface Area (BSA), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The statistical analysis was performed by Stata14 and RevMan5.4. Data processing, network evidence plots, surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, league plots and funnel plots were generated. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used as effect sizes to analyze binary categorical variables. This study included 32 RCTs with 7588 patients. Spesolimab, Rademikibart, Dupilumab, Amlitelimab were more effective than placebo in EASI-50 (RRs ranging between 1.31 and 22.65), EASI-75(RRs ranging between 1.51 and 36.58), EASI-90(RRs ranging between 3.72 and 5.49), and the percentage of patients in IGA score of 0 or 1 (RRs ranging between 1.78 and 13.36).

"Severe asthma (SA) is a heterogenous disease with multiple clinical phenotypes. 'Early atopic asthma' is the predominant phenotype in children with SA. This phenotype is also identified in adults with SA. However, the role of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy in SA is still under debate. This review summarizes current evidence linking IgE-mediated sensitization to SA. Electronic search was realized in Medline and PubMed databases by using the following terms: 'severe asthma,' 'IgE-mediated' associated with 'environmental allergens,' 'aeroallergens,' 'house dust mites,' 'pollens,' 'pets,' 'moulds,' 'cockroach,' 'food allergy,' 'drug allergy,' 'venom allergy,' 'atopic dermatitis,' 'eczema,' 'anaphylaxis.' Exposure to most aeroallergens of SA patients with atopy is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations. Children with food allergy have more severe asthma, poor symptoms control, and a high hospitalization rate. More limited evidence exists for the other IgE-mediated conditions and SA. IgE-mediated pathways play central role in the pathogenesis of various allergic diseases, including asthma. However, the allergic burden seems to be more important in children with SA than in adults.

"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in tissues. This case highlights a 29-year-old man with an unusual presentation of hemochromatosis. Persistent symptoms led to bloodwork that revealed iron overload, prompting further genetic analysis.&#xa0; The 29-year-old Caucasian man presented to his primary care provider (PCP) with complaints of an erythematous and pruritic rash across his chest and abdomen. It was thought to be irritant contact dermatitis in congruence with his past medical history. He was treated with steroids with temporary improvement. He was also referred to dermatology, where he was started on dupilumab injections for eczema. Two weeks later, the patient visited the emergency department, presenting with an erythematous and pustular rash diffusely throughout both feet. His rash was assumed to be eczematous, and he was given steroids and antibiotics due to a few open sores observed. Upon returning to his PCP for follow-up, his routine labs revealed an elevated iron level of 208. In conjunction with his skin irritation, a cheek swab was ordered to check for the C282Y gene. This prompted his new diagnosis of HH. Upon this result, he was referred to hematology for further work-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen showed evidence of diffuse iron deposition in the liver. An echocardiogram and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were found to be normal in this patient.

"Automated diagnosis of eczema using images acquired from digital camera can enable individuals to self-monitor their recovery. The process entails first segmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity of eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated eczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the severity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated data to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited training data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation, where we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot segmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and classification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and feed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of eczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated ""in-the-wild"" eczema images, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 &#xb1; 0.01) the state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted F1: 0.44 &#xb1; 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 &#xb1; 0.22).

"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, and heterogeneous skin disease characterized by eczematous morphology and intense pruritus, significantly impacting the quality of life of affected individuals. A primary cytokine implicated in AD is interleukin-13 (IL-13), which directly drives pruritus skin sensitization, contributing to pruritus. Lebrikizumab, a high-affinity IgG4 monoclonal antibody, targets IL-13 to block inflammatory and neuronal sensitization processes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of lebrikizumab's efficacy in managing pruritus in patients with AD, focusing on data from the ADvocate 1&2, ADjoin, ADmirable, and ADhere studies. Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and sustained improvements in pruritus outcomes, with significant relief observed within days of treatment initiation and maintained over long periods. Lebrikizumab has shown efficacy across diverse populations, including adolescents, the elderly, and skin of color.

"T2-comorbidities are the most common in severe asthma (SA) patients and have a negative impact on disease outcomes but also an important socio-economic burden. Treating SA and its comorbidities by one medication is a very exciting possibility for the clinicians. Several biologics used for SA showed benefits on T2-comorbidities, but currently more limited data exists for tezepelumab, most recently developed in this domain. This paper summarizes the available evidence regarding the efficacy of tezepelumab on T2-comorbidities of SA. Electronic search queries were applied to PubMed and Medline databases by using the following terms: 'tezepelumab,' 'severe asthma,' 'allergic rhinitis' (AR), 'chronic rhinosinusitis,' 'nasal polyps' (CRSwNP), 'aspirin exacerbated disease (AERD),' 'atopic dermatitis' (AD), 'eczema,' 'chronique spontaneous urticaria' (CSU),'food allergy' (FA), 'eosinophilic esophagitis' (EE). Tezepelumab treatment showed undeniable benefits on CRSwNP and AERD by improving sino-nasal and asthma outcomes. If the efficacy of tezepelumab on severe allergic asthma is well documented, current data are insufficient to conclude on its impact on AR. The effects of tezepelumab on AD and CSU were disappointing. No consistent data exists regarding FA and EE.

"The comorbidity of atopic dermatitis (AD) and depression has garnered increased attention in recent years, yet the immunopathological mechanisms underlying this connection remain unclear. To bridge this gap, the study aimed to uncover the immune regulatory networks and identify key genetic markers involved in the comorbidity of depression in AD. We performed RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from 20 AD patients with and without depression. By integrating bioinformatics analyses with machine learning, we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis, and employed machine learning models of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). Additionally, validation was carried out in an independent cohort of 20 participants to confirm the expression of the identified potential pivotal gene. A total of 394 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in AD patients with depression as compared to those non-depressed counterparts. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pinpointed a pink module encompassing 83 genes strongly linked to depressive symptoms. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted biological processes related to neurotransmitter uptake and the negative regulation of T-helper (Th) 17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, machine learning models of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) consistently identified CHN1 as a potential pivotal gene upregulated in AD patients with depression. The expression level of CHN1 demonstrated positive correlation with Th2 and Th17 cytokine signatures, as well as with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (HADS-D) score, and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Validation in an independent cohort of 20 participants confirmed the significant upregulation of CHN1 in depressed AD patients. Together, these findings reveal previously unrecognized immunoinflammatory axis underlying AD-associated depression, and shed light on CHN1 as a potential molecular bridge connecting peripheral inflammation and neuropsychiatric manifestations.",Yifei,Wang,Wang Yifei; Liu Yuqing; Chen Miao; Liu Danping; Shen Chen,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1677275,,,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Depression,,,,genetics; complications; immunology; psychology,genetics; etiology; diagnosis,methods,,,Humans,"Dermatitis, Atopic",Depression,Male,Female,2025,"dermatitis, eczema",PubMed,"dermatitis, eczema",CHN1 as a potential predictive genetic biomarker for atopic dermatitis-related depression.
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin condition affecting patients' well-being, but conventional treatments have limitations. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present a promising option for AD therapy, though large-scale clinical studies are scarce. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose tissue-derived MSC (AtMSC) in moderate to severe AD refractory to conventional treatments. This multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial included 114 participants. Participants received two intravenous injections of AtMSCs or placebo at 4-week intervals. Clinical assessments, comprising Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), were performed every 4 weeks for 16 weeks total. Biomarker analyses were conducted using ELISA. Statistically significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups in EASI total score were observed at 8, 12, and 16 weeks (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.0.017, 0.015, < 0.001). At week 16, 23.7% [14/59] of participants in the treatment group achieved a 75% or greater reduction in EASI total score (EASI-75), compared to 7.3% [4/55] in the placebo group, with a statistically significant difference (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.016). In addition, SCORAD, disease severity, and IGA score were also improved in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, the change in TARC levels from baseline to week 16 was significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups. AtMSC therapy improved moderate to severe AD, offering a promising treatment option with potential applications in chronic inflammatory diseases. Further investigation, including double-blind phase 3 trials, is needed to confirm these findings and explore additional biomarkers.
