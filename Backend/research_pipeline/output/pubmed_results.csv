40451489,Opsin 3 in keratinocytes mediates the light-induced exaggeration of atopic dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease often exaggerated by sun exposure, whereas sun-exposed regions are usually spared from psoriasis. Opsin 3 (OPN3), a photoreceptor, has been implicated in nonvisual functions of the skin including skin pigmentation and barrier restoration. However, whether OPN3 engages in light-induced inflammation of AD remains unclear. We sought to explore the role and mechanism of OPN3 in light-induced exaggeration of AD. The expression of OPN3 was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The roles of light and OPN3 in type 2 inflammation were evaluated in mouse models and cultured keratinocytes (KCs). The mechanisms by which OPN3 regulates light-induced inflammation in KCs were examined by bulk RNA-sequencing, ELISA, calcium imaging, and immunofluorescence. We found that OPN3 expression was increased in KCs of skin lesion from patients with AD and MC903-induced AD mouse model, but not patients with psoriasis or imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model. Type 2 cytokines induced OPN3 expression in KCs, which upregulated the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-36γ, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-1β. Notably, light exposure exaggerated skin inflammation in mouse model of AD, but not psoriasis. Moreover, light triggered the production of proinflammatory cytokines in KCs through OPN3-mediated calcium influx and sphingosine 1-phosphate-sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor signaling. OPN3 plays a microenvironment-specific proinflammatory role in KCs upon light exposure, and may serve as a candidate of therapeutic targets for AD.",Mao Liya; Yin Huibin; Qiu Zhuoqiong; Zhao Lingjie; Wang Shangshang et al.,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2025-05-30,"Dermatitis, Atopic; Animals; Keratinocytes; Humans; Mice; Rod Opsins; Light; Disease Models, Animal; Cytokines; Female",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40451489/
40827120,Atopic Dermatitis Management: from Conventional Therapies to Biomarker-Driven Treatment Approaches.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus, skin barrier dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. It significantly impacts the quality of life and increases the risk of infections, sleep disturbances, and psychological distress. AD pathogenesis involves genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, microbiome alterations, and immune dysfunction. Traditional treatments such as topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and systemic immunosuppressants provide symptomatic relief but often fail to provide long-term disease control. The emergence of targeted biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors has transformed AD management by offering more precise and effective therapeutic options. However, treatment responses vary, highlighting the need for biomarker-driven personalized therapies. In this review, we explore the evolving therapeutic landscape of AD, emphasizing the emerging role of biomarker-guided treatment strategies. We highlight recent discoveries of therapeutic (OX40, IgE, IL-5, IL-31, IL-22, thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and diagnostic (TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL2, filaggrin, sphingosine-1-phosphate, CXCL2) biomarkers that offer promising avenues for patient stratification and treatment monitoring. This review offers novel insight into how the convergence of biomarker research and therapeutic innovation can address current gaps in AD care. Future research should focus on refining biomarker-guided treatment strategies, optimizing therapeutic combinations, and addressing unmet patient needs. The integration of biomarker-guided strategies into routine clinical practice represents a critical step toward long-term disease control and improved quality of life for AD patients.",Lee Hye Won; Ju Yun Jin; Choi Seeun; Rhew Kiyon; Sevilleno Samantha Serafin et al.,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2025-08-19,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40827120/
40864813,Targeting Intracellular Pathways in Atopic Dermatitis with Small Molecule Therapeutics.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disorder characterized by immune dysregulation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Advances in understanding the interplay of genetic predisposition, cytokine signaling, and environmental triggers have led to the emergence of targeted therapies. Although biologic agents such as dupilumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab have revolutionized AD management, their high costs, injectable administration, and limited global accessibility highlight the need for alternative options. Small molecule therapies are gaining momentum as they target intracellular pathways central to AD pathogenesis and offer oral or topical administration routes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of key agents including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (upadacitinib, abrocitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors (crisaborole, difamilast, roflumilast, apremilast), as well as STAT6 degraders (KT621, NX3911), aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulators, histamine H4 receptor antagonists (adriforant, izuforant), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (etrasimod, BMS-986166). We summarize their mechanisms of action, pharmacological profiles, and pivotal clinical trial data, emphasizing their potential to address unmet therapeutic needs. Finally, we discuss safety concerns, long-term tolerability, and future directions for integrating small molecule therapies into precision treatment strategies for moderate-to-severe AD.",Nitulescu Georgiana; Olaru Octavian Tudorel; Andrei Corina; Nitulescu George Mihai; Zanfirescu Anca,Current issues in molecular biology,2025-08-15,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40864813/
40693579,Small EVs From Adipose-Derived MSCs Modulate Epidermal Barrier and Inflammation Via Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling Pathway.,"Epidermal permeability barrier defects are associated with several skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). Using an AD mouse model, we previously demonstrated that topically administered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) (prepared following the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles recommendations) from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) ameliorate skin inflammation and normalize barrier function in parallel with increased ceramide (a key barrier lipid) production. To elucidate how ASC-sEVs alleviate these AD skin abnormalities, we characterized lipids and ceramide metabolic enzymes in ASC-sEVs versus donor ASCs. Our study revealed that free fatty acid, ceramide, and sphingomyelin are enriched in ASC-sEVs versus donor ASCs, while the synthetic enzymes of ceramide (and acidic sphingomyelinase), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (sphingosine kinase) are significantly higher in ASC-sEVs versus donor ASCs. Conversely, ceramide (ceramidase), and sphingosine-1-phosphate hydrolytic enzymes (sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase) are lower in ASC-sEVs, suggesting that ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate levels could elevate in cells that receive ASC-sEVs. ASC-sEV-mediated increases in sphingosine-1-phosphate suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production in AD-model human keratinocytes. Additionally, keratinocyte differentiation, which is required for a competent epidermal permeability barrier, was restored in AD-model human keratinocytes treated with ASC-sEVs. Taken together, cells that endocytose ASC-sEVs can normalize epidermal permeability barrier function as well as alleviate inflammation by stimulating a sphingosine-1-phosphate signalling pathway.",Shin Kyong-Oh; Lee Jun Ho; Chae Seungwoo; Goto Karin; An Hahyun et al.,Journal of extracellular vesicles,2025-Jul-01,Lysophospholipids; Sphingosine; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Animals; Signal Transduction; Mice; Epidermis; Extracellular Vesicles; Ceramides,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40693579/
39575597,Low Incidence of Macular Edema and Other Ocular Events in the Etrasimod Development Program.,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,4,5 receptor modulator. We report the proportions and incidence rates (per 100 patient-years of exposure) of Macular edema and other ocular adverse events in the etrasimod clinical program, including patients with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, alopecia areata, and atopic dermatitis. Ulcerative colitis data were analyzed in 2 cohorts: Placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis and All ulcerative colitis (comprising the Placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis cohort plus open-label extension studies). In the Placebo-controlled ulcerative colitis cohort, Macular edema was reported in 2 patients receiving etrasimod (0.3%; incidence rate: 0.70) and 1 receiving placebo (0.3%; incidence rate: 0.84). In the All ulcerative colitis cohort, 1 patient (0.1%; incidence rate: 0.13) receiving etrasimod reported 2 events of Cystoid macular edema. All events were nonserious, and 1 led to treatment discontinuation. No events of Macular edema were reported in other conditions. Nine and 4 patients receiving etrasimod reported Vision blurred and Visual impairment adverse events, respectively. All events were nonserious and most did not require any intervention. Macular edema and other ocular events were uncommon in patients treated with etrasimod across multiple conditions. Incidence of Macular edema was comparable with placebo.

39000023,"Deciphering the Interplay between the Epithelial Barrier, Immune Cells, and Metabolic Mediators in Allergic Disease.","Chronic exposure to harmful pollutants, chemicals, and pathogens from the environment can lead to pathological changes in the epithelial barrier, which increase the risk of developing an allergy. During allergic inflammation, epithelial cells send proinflammatory signals to group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2s) and eosinophils, which require energy and resources to mediate their activation, cytokine/chemokine secretion, and mobilization of other cells. This review aims to provide an overview of the metabolic regulation in allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and allergic rhinitis (AR), highlighting its underlying mechanisms and phenotypes, and the potential metabolic regulatory roles of eosinophils and ILC2s. Eosinophils and ILC2s regulate allergic inflammation through lipid mediators, particularly cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and prostaglandins (PGs). Arachidonic acid (AA)-derived metabolites and Sphinosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are significant metabolic markers that indicate immune dysfunction and epithelial barrier dysfunction in allergy. Notably, eosinophils are promoters of allergic symptoms and exhibit greater metabolic plasticity compared to ILC2s, directly involved in promoting allergic symptoms. Our findings suggest that metabolomic analysis provides insights into the complex interactions between immune cells, epithelial cells, and environmental factors. Potential therapeutic targets have been highlighted to further understand the metabolic regulation of eosinophils and ILC2s in allergy. Future research in metabolomics can facilitate the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for future application.",Kan Lea Ling-Yu; Li Peiting; Hon Sharon Sze-Man; Lai Andrea Yin-Tung; Li Aixuan et al.,International journal of molecular sciences,2024-06-24,"Humans; Hypersensitivity; Animals; Eosinophils; Epithelial Cells; Immunity, Innate; Dermatitis, Atopic; Lymphocytes; Rhinitis, Allergic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39000023/
38388871,Etrasimod: First Approval.,"Etrasimod (VELSIPITY™) is an orally available, small-molecule selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator being developed by Pfizer for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and other immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Etrasimod is selective for S1P receptor subtypes S1P<sub>1</sub>, S1P<sub>4</sub> and S1P<sub>5</sub> while having minimal activity on S1P<sub>3</sub> and no activity on S1P<sub>2</sub>. Etrasimod received its first approval, in the USA, in October 2023 for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. Subsequently, the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion in December 2023, recommending the granting of marketing authorisation for etrasimod for the treatment of patients aged ≥ 16 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy, or a biological agent. Etrasimod is also under regulatory review for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in several other countries. Clinical development of etrasimod for use in the treatment of Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic oesophagitis and alopecia areata is ongoing worldwide. This article summarises the milestones in the development of etrasimod leading to this first approval for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults.",Shirley Matt,Drugs,2024-Feb-01,"Adult; Humans; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Acetates; Indoles",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38388871/
38724797,The Future of Atopic Dermatitis Treatment.,"This chapter thoroughly examines recent breakthroughs in atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment, with a primary focus on the medications in the development pipeline. Biologics agents targeting new interleukin receptors like interleukin-31, interleukin-22, and interleukin-2 are discussed along with the novel pathway looking at the OX40-OX40L interaction. Oral agents and small molecule therapies like Janus kinase inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also discussed along with the various new topical medications. Newly approved topicals like phosphodiesterase-4 and JAK inhibitors are highlighted while also discussing the potential of tapinarof and emerging microbiome-targeted therapies. Beyond conventional approaches, the chapter touches upon unconventional therapies currently being studied. The goal of this chapter is to discuss new advances in AD treatment from medications in the initial stages of development to those nearing FDA approval.",Lovell Katie; Patel Nupur; Rao Saroja; Strowd Lindsay C,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2024-01-01,"Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Biological Products; Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors; Janus Kinase Inhibitors; Animals; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Dermatologic Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38724797/
37801525,Ant Venom-Based Ceramide Therapy Is Effective Against Atopic Dermatitis In Vivo.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition with relatively few therapeutic alternatives. These include corticosteroids, which address inflammation but not superinfection, and Januse kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which have a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box for potential carcinogenicity. We demonstrate that S14, a synthetic derivative of ant venom-derived solenopsin, has potent anti inflammatory effects on the OVA murine model of atopic dermatitis. S14 has demonstrated prior activity in murine psoriasis and has the benefit of ceramide anti-inflammatory effects without being able to be metabolized into proinflammatory sphingosine-1 phosphate. The efficacy of S14 accompanied by the induction of IL-12 suggests a commonality in inflammatory skin disorders, and our results suggest that pharmacological ceramide restoration will be broadly effective for inflammatory skin disease. Solenopsin derivative S14 has anti-inflammatory effects in murine models of AD and psoriasis. This makes S14 a strong candidate for human use, and pre-IND studies are warranted.J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(10):1001-1006 doi:10.36849/JDD.7308.",Leyva-Castillo Juan Manuel; Huang Christina; Baker Paola; Bacsa John; Geha Raif S et al.,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2023-Oct-01,"Humans; Mice; Animals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Ant Venoms; Ceramides; Psoriasis; Anti-Inflammatory Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37801525/
36695074,"Efficacy and safety of etrasimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ADVISE).","Etrasimod is an oral, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor<sub>1,4,5</sub> modulator in development for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. Efficacy and safety of orally administered S1P receptor modulation in atopic dermatitis (AD) have not yet been examined. To assess the efficacy and safety of etrasimod monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants (≥18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD defined as baseline validated Investigator's Global Assessment (vIGA-AD) score ≥ 3, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 16, and body surface area involvement ≥10% were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily oral etrasimod 1 mg, 2 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was percent change in EASI score from baseline at week 12, assessed in the Full Analysis Set (all randomized participants). Key secondary outcomes were achievement of a vIGA-AD score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement from baseline and EASI-75 response at Week 12. Safety was assessed during the double-blind period. One hundred and forty participants were randomized to etrasimod 2 mg (n = 47), 1 mg (n = 47) or placebo (n = 46). At Week 12, percent change in EASI score was -57.2% in the etrasimod 2-mg group versus -48.4% in the placebo group (p = 0.18). A significantly greater proportion of participants receiving etrasimod 2 mg achieved vIGA-AD scores of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 12 versus placebo (29.8% vs. 13.0%; p = 0.045); however, EASI-75 response was not statistically significant versus placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in 59.6%, 40.4% and 47.8% of participants receiving etrasimod 2 mg, 1 mg and placebo, respectively. There were no serious AEs or deaths.

37047680,"Resveratrol Protects against Skin Inflammation through Inhibition of Mast Cell, Sphingosine Kinase-1, Stat3 and NF-κB p65 Signaling Activation in Mice.","Inflammation is pathogenic to skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and eczema. Treatment for AD remains mostly symptomatic with newer but costly options, tainted with adverse side effects. There is an unmet need for safe therapeutic and preventative strategies for AD. Resveratrol (R) is a natural compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, animal and human R studies have yielded contrasting results. Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune skin-resident cells that initiate the development of inflammation and progression to overt disease. R's effects on MCs are also controversial. Using a human-like mouse model of AD development consisting of a single topical application of antigen ovalbumin (O) for 7 days, we previously established that the activation of MCs by a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) initiated substantial skin remodeling compared to controls. Here, we show that daily R application normalized O-mediated epidermal thickening, ameliorated cell infiltration, and inhibited skin MC activation and chemokine expression. We unraveled R's multiple mechanisms of action, including decreased activation of the S1P-producing enzyme, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), and of transcription factors Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3) and NF-κBp65, involved in chemokine production. Thus, R may be poised for protection against MC-driven pathogenic skin inflammation.",Carlucci Christopher D; Hui Yvonne; Chumanevich Alena P; Robida Piper A; Fuseler John W et al.,International journal of molecular sciences,2023-04-04,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Chemokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Inflammation; Mast Cells; NF-kappa B; Resveratrol; Sphingosine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047680/
36674974,Sphingosine 1-Phosphate as Essential Signaling Molecule in Inflammatory Skin Diseases.,"Sphingolipids are crucial molecules of the mammalian epidermis. The formation of skin-specific ceramides contributes to the formation of lipid lamellae, which are important for the protection of the epidermis from excessive water loss and protect the skin from the invasion of pathogens and the penetration of xenobiotics. In addition to being structural constituents of the epidermal layer, sphingolipids are also key signaling molecules that participate in the regulation of epidermal cells and the immune cells of the skin. While the importance of ceramides with regard to the proliferation and differentiation of skin cells has been known for a long time, it has emerged in recent years that the sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is also involved in processes such as the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. In addition, the immunomodulatory role of this sphingolipid species is becoming increasingly apparent. This is significant as S1P mediates a variety of its actions via G-protein coupled receptors. It is, therefore, not surprising that dysregulation in the signaling pathways of S1P is involved in the pathophysiological conditions of skin diseases. In the present review, the importance of S1P in skin cells, as well as the immune cells of the skin, is elaborated. In particular, the role of the molecule in inflammatory skin diseases will be discussed. This is important because interfering with S1P signaling pathways may represent an innovative option for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.",Kleuser Burkhard; Bäumer Wolfgang,International journal of molecular sciences,2023-01-11,Animals; Sphingosine; Sphingolipids; Lysophospholipids; Ceramides; Skin Diseases; Dermatitis; Mammals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36674974/
36294465,The Dawn of a New Era in Atopic Dermatitis Treatment.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases, and the condition is typified by barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation. Recent studies have characterized various phenotypes and endotypes of AD and elucidated the mechanism. Numerous topical and systemic narrow targeting therapies for AD have been developed according to these findings. Topical medications, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist tapinarof, are effective and safe for AD compared to topical corticosteroids. Oral JAK inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, OX40, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling have displayed outstanding efficacy against moderate-to-severe AD.

35304160,Signaling sphingolipids are biomarkers for atopic dermatitis prone to disseminated viral infections.,"Life-threatening viral diseases such as eczema herpeticum (EH) and eczema vaccinatum (EV) occur in <5% of individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD). The diagnosis of AD, however, excludes all individuals with AD from smallpox vaccination. We sought to identify circulatory and skin lipid biomarkers associated with EH and EV. Stratum corneum and plasma samples from 15 subjects with AD and a history of EH, 13 age- and gender-matched subjects with AD and without EH history, and 13 healthy nonatopic (NA) controls were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for sphingolipid content. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide levels were validated in plasma samples from the Atopic Dermatitis Vaccinia Network/Atopic Dermatitis Research Network repository (12 NA, 12 AD, 23 EH) and plasma from 7 subjects with EV and 7 matched subjects with AD. S1P lyase was downregulated in human primary keratinocytes to evaluate its effect on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. The stratum corneum of patients with EH demonstrated significantly higher levels of free sphingoid bases than those in patients who were NA, indicating enhanced sphingolipid turnover in keratinocytes (P < .05). Plasma from 2 independent cohorts of patients with EH had a significantly increased S1P/ceramide ratio in subjects with EH versus those with AD and or who were NA (P < .01). The S1P level in plasma from subjects with EV was twice the level in plasma from subjects with AD (mean = 1,533 vs 732 pmol/mL; P < .001). Downregulation of S1P lyase expression with silencing RNA led to an increased S1P level and doubled HSV-1 titer in keratinocytes. Our data point to long-term abnormalities in the S1P signaling system as a biomarker for previous disseminated viral diseases and a potential treatment target in recurring infections.",Berdyshev Evgeny; Goleva Elena; Bronova Irina; Bronoff Anna Sofia; Streib Joanne E et al.,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2022-03-15,"Biomarkers; Ceramides; Dermatitis, Atopic; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Humans; Kaposi Varicelliform Eruption; Lyases; Sphingolipids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304160/
35199091,Altered Serum Phospholipids in Atopic Dermatitis and Association with Clinical Status.,"Circulating phospholipids have been considered as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in multiple disorders. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease. Although there are numerous studies having addressed stratum corneum lipids in the context of epidermal barrier, little is known about the circulating lipids in patients with AD. In this study, we explored the changes of serum phospholipids in AD using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and sought serum lipids' contribution to clinical status. Several serum levels of phospholipids were altered in the AD group (n = 179) compared with that in healthy controls (n = 47) and patients without AD with atopic comorbidities (n = 22); lipids exhibiting the apparent changes included increased sphingosine, multiple variants of phosphatidylcholine, and decreased ceramide (16:0) in patients with AD. Moreover, serum levels of sphingosine correlated with the severity of AD, and sphingosine and ceramide(16:0) were also detected as the risk-increasing effect and risk-reduction effect of AD, respectively. In summary, alterations in the serum concentration of phospholipids are seen in patients with AD. Although more detailed investigations will be needed to evaluate the significance of the changes in circulating lipids in AD, these findings can provide, to our knowledge, previously unreported insight into AD's pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.",Sakai Takashi; Herrmann Nadine; Maintz Laura; Nümm Tim Joachim; Welchowski Thomas et al.,JID innovations : skin science from molecules to population health,2021-12-22,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35199091/
34679239,Novel functions of S1P in chronic itchy and inflammatory skin diseases.,"S1P is a pleotropic sphingolipid signalling molecule that acts through binding to five high-affinity G-protein coupled receptors. S1P-signaling affects cell fate in a multitude of ways, e.g. influencing cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as playing an important role in immune cell trafficking. Though many effects of S1P-signaling in the human body have been discovered, the full range of functions is yet to be understood. For inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, evidence is emerging that dysfunction and imbalance of the S1P-axis is a contributing factor. Multiple studies investigating the efficacy of S1PR modulators in alleviating the severity and symptoms of skin conditions in various animal models and human clinical trials have shown promising results and validated the interest in the S1P-axis as a potential therapeutic target. Even though the involvement of S1P-signalling in inflammatory skin diseases still requires further clarification, the implications of the recent findings may prompt expansion of research to additional skin conditions and more S1P-axis modulatory pharmaceuticals.",Gray N; Limberg M M; Bräuer A U; Raap U,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2021-11-12,Animals; Dermatitis; Humans; Lysophospholipids; Signal Transduction; Skin Diseases; Sphingosine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34679239/
34238587,"Risk of Thromboembolic Events and Associated Risk Factors, Including Treatments, in Patients with Immune-mediated Diseases.","This study assessed the association between thromboembolic events (TEs) and immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) and characterized the risk profile of TEs among patients with IMDs. An administrative claims database (2014-2018) was used to identify adults with ≥2 diagnoses on different dates for ≥1 IMD (IMD cohort; ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus); patients without an IMD diagnosis were assigned to the non-IMD cohort. Patients in the IMD cohort were matched 1:1 to patients in the non-IMD cohort on age, sex, and index date. Incremental risk of TE (ie, deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE], myocardial infarction [MI], and ischemic stroke [IS]) was assessed using adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to control for covariates in both cohorts. Risk factors for TEs were assessed in the IMD cohort and included age, female sex, comorbidities, baseline TEs, non-IMD treatments, and IMD treatments. A total of 182,431 patients were included in each cohort (mean age, [51.3] years; 64.3% female). A higher proportion of patients in the IMD cohort versus the non-IMD cohort had ≥1 baseline TE (4.1% vs 2.7%; P < 0.0001). The IMD cohort had a 1.80 (95% CI, 1.68-1.92; P < 0.0001) times higher rate of TEs versus patients in the non-IMD cohort. After adjustments, patients in the IMD cohort had a 1.49 (95% CI, 1.40-1.59; P < 0.0001) times higher rate of TEs versus patients in the non-IMD cohort. Similar results were observed across individual TEs (DVT: aIRR = 1.78; PE: aIRR = 1.66; MI: aIRR = 1.17; IS: aIRR = 1.35; all P < 0.05). Risk factor profiles varied by TE. The greatest risk factor was respective TE during baseline (eg, patients with baseline DVT had 41.1 times the rate of DVT during the study period vs patients without baseline DVT; P < 0.001). Comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, were associated with increased rates of MI (IRR = 2.60, 1.30, and 1.54, respectively; all P < 0.05) and IS (IRR = 1.53, 1.54, and 1.24, respectively; all P < 0.05).

33197483,Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 Is Central to Maintaining Epidermal Barrier Homeostasis.,"The outer layer of the epidermis composes the skin barrier, a sophisticated filter constituted by layers of corneocytes in a lipid matrix. The matrix lipids, especially the ceramide-generated sphingosine 1-phosphate, are the messengers that the skin barrier uses to communicate with the basal layer of the epidermis where replicating keratinocytes are located. Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a bioactive sphingolipid mediator involved in various cellular functions through S1PR1‒5, expressed by keratinocytes. We discovered that the S1pr2 absence is linked to an impairment in the skin barrier function. Although S1pr2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse skin has no difference in its phenotype and barrier function compared with that of wild-type mouse, after tape stripping, S1pr2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse showed significantly higher transepidermal water loss and required another 24 hours to normalize their transepidermal water loss levels. Moreover, after epicutaneous Staphylococcus aureus application, impaired S1pr2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse epidermal barrier function allowed deeper bacterial penetration and denser neutrophil infiltration in the dermis. Microarray and RNA sequence of S1pr2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse epidermis linked the barrier dysfunction with a decrease in FLG2 and tight junction components. In conclusion, S1pr2<sup>-/-</sup> mice have compromised skin barrier function and increased bacteria permeability, making them a suitable model for diseases that present similar characteristics, such as atopic dermatitis.",Igawa Satomi; Ohzono Ayaka; Pham Phoebe; Wang Zhenping; Nakatsuji Teruaki et al.,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2020-11-14,"Animals; Cells, Cultured; Epidermis; Filaggrin Proteins; Homeostasis; Humans; Lysophospholipids; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Permeability",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33197483/
37885821,The mast cell/S1P axis is not linked to pre-lesional male skin remodeling in a mouse model of eczema.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD, eczema) is an inflammatory skin condition whose histopathology involves remodeling. Few preclinical AD studies are performed using male mice. The histopathological mechanisms underlying AD development were investigated here in male mice at a pre-lesional stage using a human AD-like mouse model. Hypodermal cellular infiltration without thickening of skin layers was observed after one epicutaneous exposure to antigen ovalbumin (OVA), compared to controls. In contrast to our previous report using female mice, OVA treatment did not activate skin mast cells (MC) or elevate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels while increasing systemic but not local levels of CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 chemokines. In contrast to the pathogenic AD mechanisms we recently uncovered in female, S1P-mediated skin MC activation with subsequent local chemokine production is not observed in male mice, supporting sex differences in pre-lesional stages of AD. We are proposing that differential involvement of the MC/S1P axis in early pathogenic skin changes contributes to the well documented yet still incompletely understood sex-dimorphic susceptibility to AD in humans.",Tanis Ross M; Wedman-Robida Piper A; Chumanevich Alena P; Fuseler John W; Oskeritzian Carole A,AIMS allergy and immunology,2021-05-28,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37885821/

In this study, we investigated the roles of S1P receptor type 2 (S1P<sub>2</sub>) in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis, which was induced by topical application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) on ventral skin on D0, followed by repeated DNCB challenge on both ears from D7 to D49. Wild-type mice with atopic dermatitis displayed severe inflammation and mast cell accumulation in ear tissues and elevated IgE levels in serum. Furthermore, the mice showed significantly increased sizes of draining lymph nodes, high levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-γ) in the ears and lymph nodes and high levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 in ears. Administration of JTE-013, a selective antagonist of S1P<sub>2</sub> (3 mg/kg, i.p, from D19 to D49) before DNCB challenge significantly suppressed DNCB-induced atopic responses in ears and lymph nodes. JTE-013 administration also significantly decreased the lymph nodes sizes, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, and IFN-γ) in the ears and lymph nodes, and the levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 in ears. Furthermore, the inflammatory responses of atopic dermatitis were greatly ameliorated in S1pr2 gene-deficient mice. As CCL17 and CCL22 are CCR4 ligands, acting as Th2-attracting chemokines, we investigated CCL17 and CCL22 expression in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from wild-type and S1pr2 gene-deficient mice. Addition of IL-4 (10 ng/mL) markedly increased the levels of CCL17 and CCL22, but IL-4-induced CCL17 and CCL22 expression was significantly blunted in BMDCs from S1pr2 gene-deficient mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with JTE-013 (1-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed this induction in BMDCs from wild-type mice.

32514255,"A novel sphingosylphosphorylcholine and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 antagonist, KRO-105714, for alleviating atopic dermatitis.","Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a type of inflammation of the skin, which presents with itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. The high global incidence of atopic dermatitis makes it one of the major skin diseases threatening public health. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) act as pro-inflammatory mediators, as an angiogenesis factor and a mitogen in skin fibroblasts, respectively, both of which are important biological responses to atopic dermatitis. The SPC level is known to be elevated in atopic dermatitis, resulting from abnormal expression of sphingomyelin (SM) deacylase, accompanied by a deficiency in ceramide. Also, S1P and its receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) are important targets in treating atopic dermatitis. In this study, we found a novel antagonist of SPC and S1P1, KRO-105714, by screening 10,000 compounds. To screen the compounds, we used an SPC-induced cell proliferation assay based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) system and a human S1P1 protein-based [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTPγS binding assay. In addition, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of KRO-105714 on atopic dermatitis through related cell-based assays, including a tube formation assay, a cell migration assay, and an ELISA assay on inflammatory cytokines. Finally, we confirmed that KRO-105714 alleviates atopic dermatitis symptoms in a series of mouse models.

The literature is rapidly growing of successful examples of compounds targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), Janus kinase (JAK), caspase 1, and histone deacetylase (HDAC), for the treatment of skin inflammatory, autoimmune, and oncological diseases.

To investigate the effect of diet and the bile acid (BA) receptors, such as TGR5 (Takeda G protein receptor 5) and S1PR2 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2) in the development of dermatitis. C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) since weaning until they were 10 months old followed by analyzing histology, gene expression, and BA profiling. Mice developed dermatitis as they aged and the incidence was higher in females than males. Additionally, WD intake substantially increased the incidence of dermatitis. Cutaneous antimicrobial peptide genesS100A8, S100A9, and Defb4 were reduced in WD-fed mice, but increased when mice developed skin lesions. In addition, Tgr5 and TGR5-regulated Dio2 and Nos3 were reduced in WD intake but induced in dermatitic lesions. Trpa1 and Trpv1, which mediate itch, were also increased in dermatitic lesions. The expression of S1pr2 and genes encoding sphingosine kinases, S1P phosphatases, binding protein, and transporter were all reduced by WD intake but elevated in dermatitic lesions. Furthermore, dermatitis development increased total cutaneous BA with an altered profile, which may change TGR5 and S1PR2 activity. Moreover, supplementation with BA sequestrant cholestyramine reduced epidermal thickening as well as cutaneous inflammatory cytokines. In summary, activation of TGR5 and S1PR2, which regulate itch, keratinocyte proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation, may contribute to WD-exacerbated dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 features.

Importantly, we demonstrate that skin mast cell (MC) activation and local sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are significantly augmented after OVA treatment in mice. Deficiency in sphingosine kinase (SphK)1, the S1P-producing enzyme, or in MC, remarkably mitigates all signs of OVA-mediated remodeling and MC activation. Furthermore, skin S1P levels remain unchanged in MC-deficient mice exposed to OVA. LPS-free OVA does not recapitulate any of the precursor signs of AD, supporting a triggering contribution of LPS in AD that, per se, suffice to activate local MC and elevate skin S1P. We describe MC and S1P as novel pathogenic effectors that initiate remodeling in AD prior to any skin lesions and reveal the significance of LPS in OVA used in most studies, thus mimicking natural antigen (Ag) exposure.",Wedman P A; Aladhami A; Chumanevich A P; Fuseler J W; Oskeritzian C A,Allergy,2017-10-11,"Administration, Topical; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Eczema; Female; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lysophospholipids; Mast Cells; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28905998/
27107674,"Synthesis and degradation pathways, functions, and pathology of ceramides and epidermal acylceramides.","Ceramide (Cer) is a structural backbone of sphingolipids and is composed of a long-chain base and a fatty acid. Existence of a variety of Cer species, which differ in chain-length, hydroxylation status, and/or double bond number of either of their hydrophobic chains, has been reported. Ceramide is produced by Cer synthases. Mammals have six Cer synthases (CERS1-6), each of which exhibits characteristic substrate specificity toward acyl-CoAs with different chain-lengths. Knockout mice for each Cer synthase show corresponding, isozyme-specific phenotypes, revealing the functional differences of Cers with different chain-lengths. Cer diversity is especially prominent in epidermis. Changes in Cer levels, composition, and chain-lengths are associated with atopic dermatitis. Acylceramide (acyl-Cer) specifically exists in epidermis and plays an essential role in skin permeability barrier formation. Accordingly, defects in acyl-Cer synthesis cause the cutaneous disorder ichthyosis with accompanying severe skin barrier defects. Although the molecular mechanism by which acyl-Cer is generated was long unclear, most genes involved in its synthesis have been identified recently. In Cer degradation pathways, the long-chain base moiety of Cer is converted to acyl-CoA, which is then incorporated mainly into glycerophospholipids. This pathway generates the lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate.

26803226,Sphingosine 1-phospate differentially modulates maturation and function of human Langerhans-like cells.,"As mediators between innate and adaptive immune responses, Langerhans cells (LCs) are in the focus of recent investigations to determine their role in allergic inflammatory diseases like allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a crucial lipid mediator in the skin and potentially interferes with LC homeostasis but also functional properties, such as cytokine release, migration and antigen-uptake which are considered to be key events in the initiation and maintenance of pathological disorders. Here, we used human Langerhans-like cells to study the influence of S1P-mediated signalling on LC maturation, cytokine release, migration and endocytosis. Immature Langerhans-like cells were generated from the human acute myeloid leukaemia cell line MUTZ-3 (MUTZ-LCs) and human primary monocytes (MoLCs). S1P receptor expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Expression of maturation markers were investigated by flow cytometry. The influence of S1P signalling on cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Migration assays and FITC-dextran uptake in the presence of S1P, specific S1 P receptor agonists and antagonists as well as fingolimod (FTY720) were analysed through fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. S1P receptor protein expression was confirmed for S1P1, S1P2 and S1P4 in MUTZ-LCs and S1P1 and S1P2 in MoLCs. In mature cells S1P receptors were downregulated. S1P did not induce maturation in MUTZ-LCs, whereas in MoLCs CD83 and CD86 were slightly upregulated. IL-8 release of MUTZ-LCs matured in the presence of S1P was not altered, however, reduced IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels were observed in mature MoLCs. Interestingly, immature MUTZ-LCs revealed a significantly increased S1P-dependent migratory capacity, whereas CCL20 induced migration was significantly decreased in the presence of S1P. Furthermore, migratory capacity towards CCL21 in mature MUTZ-LCs but not MoLCs was significantly lower when cells were stimulated with S1P. S1P, FTY720 and specific S1P receptor agonists did not modulate the endocytotic capacity of immature MUTZ-LCs and MoLCs. These findings were further supported by testing specific antagonists of S1P1-4 in the absence or presence of S1P. Our data demonstrate that S1P regulates key events of human LC maturation including cytokine release and migration. These findings are of particular importance when considering the potential use of S1P in inflammatory skin disorders.",Bock Stephanie; Pfalzgraff Anja; Weindl Günther,Journal of dermatological science,2016-01-09,"Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cytokines; Endocytosis; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Humans; Langerhans Cells; Lysophospholipids; Phenotype",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26803226/

Ceramides, as a part of extracellular lipids in the stratum corneum, are important elements of the skin barrier and are involved in the prevention of transepidermal water loss. In addition, ceramides regulate such processes as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of keratinocytes. Another important sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of keratinocytes.

24434636,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate differently regulates the cytokine production of IL-12, IL-23 and IL-27 in activated murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells.","Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulates many cell functions such as lymphocyte trafficking and signaling as well as keratinocyte proliferation. However, less is known about the specific effects of S1P on cytokine production, particularly on the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and keratinocytes, cell types which are crucial for the initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Especially the cytokines of the IL-12 family play a dominant role in many inflammatory diseases as they have a significant impact on T-helper cell function. In the present study we show that S1P decreased the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 in LPS-stimulated DCs via the common subunit p40 as well as in the crosstalk with activated keratinocytes. By using specific S1P receptor agonists (SEW2871, FTY720-P) and antagonist (JTE013) we identified an important role for S1P receptor 1 in the modulation of the cytokine profile. While diminishing IL-12 and IL-23 secretion, S1P enhanced IL-27 production in DCs. To elucidate the mechanism of the different impact on the IL-12 family cytokine production, we investigated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in DCs. By using specific MAPK-Inhibitors (U0126, SB202190, SP600125) we demonstrated that ERK, p38 and JNK differently regulate each pathway of each cytokine. While p38 and JNK did not seem to play a role in the modulation properties of S1P on cytokine production, ERK is at least partially involved in the S1P mediated modulation of IL-12 and IL-27. The PI3K-Inhibitor abrogated the S1P-induced decrease of IL-12 and IL-23 secretion, while it had no influence on the S1P-induced increase of IL-27 production. These data implicate, that S1P has an anti-inflammatory impact on the production of IL-12 family cytokines, indicating therapeutic potential for S1P treatment of several inflammatory diseases like psoriasis.",Schaper Katrin; Kietzmann Manfred; Bäumer Wolfgang,Molecular immunology,2014-01-14,"Androstadienes; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Cells, Cultured; Dendritic Cells; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression; Immunoblotting; Interleukin-12; Interleukin-23",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24434636/
24586752,Pseudomonas-derived ceramidase induces production of inflammatory mediators from human keratinocytes via sphingosine-1-phosphate.,"Ceramide is important for water retention and permeability barrier functions in the stratum corneum, and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). A Pseudomonas aeruginosa-derived neutral ceramidase (PaCDase) isolated from a patient with AD was shown to effectively degrade ceramide in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus-derived lipids or neutral detergents. However, the effect of ceramide metabolites on the functions of differentiating keratinocytes is poorly understood. We found that the ceramide metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) stimulated the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-8 from three-dimensionally cultured human primary keratinocytes (termed ""3D keratinocytes""), which form a stratum corneum. PaCDase alone did not affect TNF-α gene expression in 3D keratinocytes. In the presence of the detergent Triton X-100, which damages stratum corneum structure, PaCDase, but not heat-inactivated PaCDase or PaCDase-inactive mutant, induced the production of TNF-α, endothelin-1, and IL-8, indicating that this production was dependent on ceramidase activity. Among various ceramide metabolites, sphingosine and S1P enhanced the gene expression of TNF-α, endothelin-1, and IL-8. The PaCDase-enhanced expression of these genes was inhibited by a sphingosine kinase inhibitor and by an S1P receptor antagonist VPC 23019. The TNF-α-binding antibody infliximab suppressed the PaCDase-induced upregulation of IL-8, but not TNF-α, mRNA. PaCDase induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. The NF-κB inhibitor curcumin significantly inhibited PaCDase-induced expression of IL-8 and endothelin-1. VPC 23019 and infliximab inhibited PaCDase-induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and reduction in the protein level of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Collectively, these findings suggest that (i) 3D keratinocytes produce S1P from sphingosine, which is produced through the hydrolysis of ceramide by PaCDase, (ii) S1P induces the production of TNF-α via S1P receptors, and (iii) released TNF-α stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-8.",Oizumi Ami; Nakayama Hitoshi; Okino Nozomu; Iwahara Chihiro; Kina Katsunari et al.,PloS one,2014-02-25,"Cells, Cultured; Endothelin-1; Humans; I-kappa B Proteins; Inflammation Mediators; Interleukin-8; Keratinocytes; Lysophospholipids; NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha; Neutral Ceramidase",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24586752/
26120515,Sphingosine-1-phosphate as signaling molecule in the skin: Relevance in atopic dermatitis.,"Sphingolipids are essential molecules of the mammalian epidermis. Keratinocytes generate and secrete huge amounts of ceramide-precursors to the extracellular domain of the stratum corneum, where they are further metabolized to specific ceramide species. The arrangement of ceramides to well-organized lipid lamellae is essential to form the epidermal barrier. Besides their role as structural components sphingolipids are also critical molecules involved in the modulation of epidermal cells. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been identified as a prominent signaling molecule which regulates fundamental functions of keratinocytes and skin dendritic cells. Thus, S1P inhibits proliferation of keratinocytes and induces their differentiation. Moreover, antigen uptake, migration and cytokine production of dendritic cells are under the control of this sphingolipid. A dysregulation of the sphingolipid metabolism has been discussed in inflammatory skin disorders like atopic dermatitis. Animal models of contact dermatitis provide evidence that topical treatment with S1P is connected with an anti-inflammatory action suggesting a novel approach for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.",Japtok Lukasz; Bäumer Wolfgang; Kleuser Burkhard,Allergo journal international,2014-03-19,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26120515/
24244808,Sphingolipids and antimicrobial peptides: function and roles in atopic dermatitis.,"Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and rosacea were complicated by barrier abrogation and deficiency in innate immunity. The first defender of epidermal innate immune response is the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that exhibit a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against multiple pathogens, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The deficiency of these AMPs in the skin of AD fails to protect our body against virulent pathogen infections. In contrast to AD where there is a suppression of AMPs, rosacea is characterized by overexpression of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP), the products of which result in chronic epidermal inflammation. In this regard, AMP generation that is controlled by a key ceramide metabolite S1P-dependent mechanism could be considered as alternate therapeutic approaches to treat these skin disorders, i.e., Increased S1P levels strongly stimulated the CAMP expression which elevated the antimicrobial activity against multiple pathogens resulting the improved AD patient skin.",Park Kyungho; Lee Sinhee; Lee Yong-Moon,Biomolecules & therapeutics,2013-Jul-30,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24244808/
23563666,Sphingolipids and inflammatory diseases of the skin.,"Mammalian skin protects our body against external assaults due to a well-organized skin barrier. The formation of the skin barrier is a complex process, in which basal keratinocytes lose their mitotic activity and differentiate to corneocytes. These corneocytes are embedded in intercellular lipid lamellae composed of ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, and cholesterol esters. Ceramides are the dominant lipid molecules and their reduction is connected with a transepidermal water loss and an epidermal barrier dysfunction resulting in inflammatory skin diseases. Moreover, bioactive sphingolipid metabolites like ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate are also involved in the biological modulation of keratinocytes and immune cells of the skin. Therefore, it is not astonishing that a dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism has been identified in inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris. This chapter will describe not only the specific sphingolipid species and their skin functions but also the dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in inflammatory skin diseases.",Kleuser Burkhard; Japtok Lukasz,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2013-01-01,"Animals; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Langerhans Cells; Permeability; Psoriasis; Signal Transduction; Skin; Skin Absorption; Sphingolipids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23563666/
23145172,Sphingosine 1-phosphate modulates antigen capture by murine Langerhans cells via the S1P2 receptor subtype.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the development of cutaneous contact hypersensitivity (CHS) and atopic dermatitis as they capture and process antigen and present it to T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs. Recently, it has been indicated that a topical application of the sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) prevents the inflammatory response in CHS, but the molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. Here we indicate that treatment of mice with S1P is connected with an impaired antigen uptake by Langerhans cells (LCs), the initial step of CHS. Most of the known actions of S1P are mediated by a family of five specific G protein-coupled receptors. Our results indicate that S1P inhibits macropinocytosis of the murine LC line XS52 via S1P(2) receptor stimulation followed by a reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. As down-regulation of S1P(2) not only diminished S1P-mediated action but also enhanced the basal activity of LCs on antigen capture, an autocrine action of S1P has been assumed. Actually, S1P is continuously produced by LCs and secreted via the ATP binding cassette transporter ABCC1 to the extracellular environment. Consequently, inhibition of ABCC1, which decreased extracellular S1P levels, markedly increased the antigen uptake by LCs. Moreover, stimulation of sphingosine kinase activity, the crucial enzyme for S1P formation, is connected not only with enhanced S1P levels but also with diminished antigen capture. These results indicate that S1P is essential in LC homeostasis and influences skin immunity. This is of importance as previous reports suggested an alteration of S1P levels in atopic skin lesions.",Japtok Lukasz; Schaper Katrin; Bäumer Wolfgang; Radeke Heinfried H; Jeong Se Kyoo et al.,PloS one,2012-11-08,"Administration, Topical; Animals; Antigens; Cells, Cultured; Dermatitis, Contact; Endocytosis; Female; Homeostasis; Langerhans Cells; Lysophospholipids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23145172/

20802177,FTY720 regulates bone marrow egress of eosinophils and modulates late-phase skin reaction in mice.,"Eosinophilia in the blood and skin is frequently observed in patients with certain inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. However, the mechanism underlying eosinophil circulation and the role of eosinophils in cutaneous immune responses remain unclear. In repeated hapten application-induced cutaneous responses in BALB/c mice, the administration of FTY720 before the last challenge decreased the number of skin-infiltrating eosinophils and reduced the late-phase reaction. A similar reduction of the late-phase reaction was observed by a sphingosine-1-phosphate G protein-coupled receptor (S1P1)-selective agonist, SEW2871. We monitored numerous alterations of eosinophils in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes of interleukin-5 transgenic mice, used as an eosinophilia model, following FTY720 administration. The number of circulating eosinophils was significantly decreased after treatment with FTY720, and eosinophils accumulated in the bone marrow. In addition, eosinophils expressed S1P1, S1P3, and S1P4 mRNAs, and their chemotactic response to S1P was abolished by FTY720 as well as by SEW2871. These findings suggest that FTY720 affects the number of eosinophils in both the blood and skin by inhibiting the egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow and thus downmodulating the late-phase reaction.",Sugita Kazunari; Kabashima Kenji; Sakabe Jun-Ichi; Yoshiki Ryutaro; Tanizaki Hideaki et al.,The American journal of pathology,2010-08-27,"Animals; Blotting, Western; Bone Marrow; Cell Movement; Chemotaxis; Disease Models, Animal; Eosinophils; Female; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Flow Cytometry",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20802177/
19194476,Topical application of sphingosine-1-phosphate and FTY720 attenuate allergic contact dermatitis reaction through inhibition of dendritic cell migration.,"Migration of Langerhans cells (LCs) from the skin to the lymph node is an essential step in the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Therefore, inhibition of LC-migration could be a promising strategy to improve this skin disease. Effects of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the immunomodulator FTY720 on LC trafficking is not well defined, yet. Thus, we investigated the action of topically administered S1P and FTY720 in a murine model of ACD. Most interestingly, FTY720 as well as S1P inhibited the inflammatory reaction in the elicitation phase of ACD. In the sensitization phase, FTY720, and S1P reduced the weight and cell count of the draining auricular lymph node, as well as immigrated dendritic cells provoked by repetitive topical administration of the hapten. Correspondingly, the density of LCs in the epidermis was higher in FTY720- and S1P-treated mice compared to vehicle treatment. A skin dendritic cell migration assay confirmed the significant inhibition of dendritic cell migration by FTY720 and S1P. These data supply conclusive evidence that the strategy of targeting the migratory response of LCs with locally acting S1P or FTY720 represents an emerging option in the treatment of allergic skin diseases like contact hypersensitivity and atopic dermatitis.",Reines Ilka; Kietzmann Manfred; Mischke Reinhard; Tschernig Thomas; Lüth Anja et al.,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2009-02-05,"Administration, Topical; Animals; Cell Movement; Dendritic Cells; Dermatitis, Allergic Contact; Female; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lysophospholipids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19194476/
19394200,Gene expression in canine atopic dermatitis and correlation with clinical severity scores.,"Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a common condition in dogs that may be a naturally occurring model for human atopic dermatitis (hAD). Despite this, comparative research is limited, particularly into the genetic background of cAD. 1. Measure candidate gene expression in cAD skin using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). 2. Correlate gene expression to clinical cAD scores (Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index[CADESI]-03 and intradermal allergen test [IDT]). mRNA was extracted from biopsies of non-lesional and lesional skin from atopic dogs, and healthy skin from non-atopic dogs. Gene expression was quantified using qPCR, and compared between non-lesional atopic, lesional atopic and healthy skin. Gene expression in atopic skin was correlated with clinical severity (CADESI-03) and the number of positive reactions on an IDT. Of the 20 quantified genes, 11 demonstrated statistically significant altered mRNA expression between atopic and healthy skin; dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4), phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-5-phosphatase-2 (INPPL1), serine protease inhibitor kazal type-5 (SPINK5), sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase-1 (SGPL1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), Periostin (POSTN), Cullin4A, TNF-alpha and metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 (TIMP-1). Three genes correlated with CADESI-03: serum amyloid A 1 (SAA-1), S100A8, and PKP2; and four with IDT results: mast cell protease I (CMA1), SAA-1, S100A8 and SPINK5. Genes with altered expression included those relevant to skin barrier formation and immune function, suggesting both are relevant in the pathogenesis of AD. Many of these genes reflect the proposed pathogenesis in hAD, supporting the use of dogs as a model for hAD. Furthermore, these genes may be considered suitable targets for future genetic and protein function studies in human and canine AD.",Wood Shona H; Clements Dylan N; Ollier William E; Nuttall Tim; McEwan Neil A et al.,Journal of dermatological science,2009-04-24,"Allergens; Animals; Base Sequence; Dermatitis, Atopic; Disease Models, Animal; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19394200/
18385762,"K6PC-5, a direct activator of sphingosine kinase 1, promotes epidermal differentiation through intracellular Ca2+ signaling.","Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, regulates multiple cellular responses such as Ca(2+) signaling, growth, survival, and differentiation. Because sphingosine kinase (SphK) is the enzyme directly responsible for production of S1P, many factors have been identified that regulate its activity and subsequent S1P levels. Here we synthesized a previously unidentified SphK activator, K6PC-5, and have studied its effects on intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in HaCaT cells and epidermal differentiation in murine skin. K6PC-5, a hydrophobic compound chemically named N-(1,3-dihydroxyisopropyl)-2-hexyl-3-oxo-decanamide, activated SphK (obtained from C57BL/6 murine blood and F9-12 cell lysates) in a dose-dependent manner. K6PC-5 induced both intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillations in HaCaT cells and Ca(2+) mobilization in hairless mouse epidermis. Both dimethylsphingosine (DMS) and dihydroxysphingosine (DHS), SphK inhibitors, and transfection of SphK1-siRNA blocked K6PC-5-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i). The K6PC-5-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were dependent on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca(2+) stores and Ca(2+) entry, but independent of the classical phospholipase C-mediated pathway. In addition, K6PC-5 enhanced the expression of involucrin and filaggrin, specific differentiation-associated marker proteins in HaCaT cells, whereas transfection of SphK1-siRNA blocked the increase of involucrin. Topical K6PC-5 also enhanced the expression of involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, and keratin 5 in intact murine epidermis. Finally, topical K6PC-5 inhibited epidermal hyperplasia by exerting antiproliferative effects on keratinocytes in murine epidermis. These results suggest that K6PC-5 acts to regulate both differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes via [Ca(2+)](i) responses through S1P production. Thus, regulation of S1P levels may represent a novel approach for treatment of skin disorders characterized by abnormal differentiation and proliferation, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.",Hong Jeong Hee; Youm Jong-Kyung; Kwon Mi Jung; Park Byeong Deog; Lee Yong-Moon et al.,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2008-04-03,"Amides; Animals; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Enzyme Activators; Epidermis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18385762/
18039015,Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and the skin.,"Sphingolipids have long been viewed as rather passive structural components of cellular membranes. More recently, it has become evident that metabolism of sphingomyelin yields several lipid mediators that evoke diverse and specific responses in different cell types. One sphingomyelin derivate, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), has attracted particular attention for its effect on epidermal cells, which differs from those on most other cell types. S1P inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and induces keratinocyte differentiation and migration, suggesting a role for S1P in the re-epithelialization of wounds. The migratory response involves the phosphorylation and activation of Smad3. In epithelial tumors, S1P signaling has been linked with potential oncogenic effects, but has also been found to inhibit metastasis in a mouse melanoma model. S1P promotes endothelial cell survival, acts as a chemoattractant for vascular cells, and exerts a protective effect on the endothelial barrier. Conversely, S1P receptor knockout leads to embryonic lethality mainly due to impaired vascular maturation. S1P presumably modulates peripheral T-lymphocyte levels by stimulating their egress from lymphoid organs rather than by promoting T-cell proliferation. The S1P analog FTY720 (fingolimod) acts as a functional antagonist by inhibiting lymphocyte egress, and thus holds great promise as an immunosuppressant drug for the prevention of allograft rejection and treatment of T-lymphocyte-driven inflammatory skin diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Topical use of S1P and other sphingosine compounds is also under investigation, particularly for the treatment of acne vulgaris.",Herzinger Thomas; Kleuser Burkhard; Schäfer-Korting Monika; Korting Hans Christian,American journal of clinical dermatology,2007-01-01,"Acne Vulgaris; Animals; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Connective Tissue; Epidermis; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Humans; Immunity; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lysophospholipids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18039015/
11590211,Sphingosylphosphorylcholine is an activator of transglutaminase activity in human keratinocytes.,"We characterize functional roles of a newly discovered chemical, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), in the epidermis by elucidating the biological effect of SPC on human keratinocytes in culture. The intracellular calcium level of human keratinocytes was increased by incubation with SPC, but not with sphingosine (SS) or sphingomyelin (SM). The addition of SPC, sphingosine 1-phosphate (SSP), or SS to human keratinocytes at 10 microM concentrations also significantly suppressed DNA synthesis, and SPC, but not SSP, or SS increased the activities of membrane-bound and soluble transglutaminases (TGases). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of TGase transcripts revealed that SPC treatment at 10 microM concentrations increased the expression of TGase 1 mRNA. The increased activity of soluble TGase was accompanied by the concomitant activation of cathepsin D as revealed by the increased ratio of mature active form to inactive intermediate form of the protease. Pretreatment of human keratinocytes with pepstatin, a protease inhibitor, blocked the increase in soluble TGase activity induced by treatment with SPC. Consistently, SPC treatment at 1-10 microM concentrations stimulated the cornified envelope formation. These findings suggest that SPC plays an important role in the altered keratinization process of epidermis in skin diseases with high expression of sphingomyelin deacylase, such as atopic dermatitis.",Higuchi K; Kawashima M; Takagi Y; Kondo H; Yada Y et al.,Journal of lipid research,2001-Oct-01,"Calcium; Cathepsin D; Cell Division; Cells, Cultured; DNA; Enzyme Activation; Humans; Keratinocytes; Phosphorylcholine; RNA, Messenger",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11590211/
